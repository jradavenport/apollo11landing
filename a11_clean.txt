00 03 38 07        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
I thought it went pretty well, Houston, although I expect I used more gas than I've been using in the simulator. The turnaround maneuver - I went PITCH ACEL COMMAND and started to pitch up, and then when I put MANUAL, ATTITUDE PITCH back to RATE COMMAND for some reason it - it stopped its pitch rate, and I had to go back to ACCEL COMMAND and hit what I thought was an extra PROCEED on the DSKY. During the course of that, we drifted slightly further away from the S IVB than I expected. I expected to be out about 66 feet. My guess would be I was around 100 or so; and therefore, I expect I used a bit more coming back in. But, except for using a little more gas - And I'd be interested in your numbers on that - everything went nominally.

Well, we didn't have much time, Houston, to talk to you about our views out the window when we were preparing for LM ejection; but up to that time, we had the entire northern part of the lighted hemisphere visible including North America, North Atlantic, and Europe and Northern Africa. We could see that the weather was good all - just about everywhere. There was one cyclonic depression in Northern Canada, in the Athabaska - probably east of Athabaska area. Greenland was clear, and it appeared to be we were seeing just the icecap in Greenland. All North Atlantic was pretty good; and Europe and Northern Africa seemed to be clear. Most of the United States was clear. There was a low - looked like a front stretching from the center of the country up across north of the Great Lakes and into Newfoundland.

Roger. Leave them on there probably a second, please.
<br><br>

Will do.
<br><br>
00 05 36 22        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

Apollo 11, this is Houston. Could you give us a - an AUTO optics check to a third star or a different star from the one you've been using?
<br><br>
00 05 41 45        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Sure, be glad to. I can go back and do the whole thing and pick different stars.
<br><br>
00 05 41 52        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
I don't think there - there's any need to do that. We'd just like to confirm it with a different star, since that roll angle was a little larger than we expected.

Negative. We don't believe so, Apollo 11. We think that this is possibly due to some TLI dispersions, and it's probably satisfactory. So go ahead and accept this.

Okay, Charlie. It just appears to me that you have to have a reticle tangent to the horizon at the point at which you mark or else you're not at the substellar point; you're off laterally, and therefore you're measuring a larger trunnion angle than you should.

Roger, 11. Read you about four-by. How me? Over.
<br><br>
00 09 22 46        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
You're loud and clear, Charlie. We pitched down some to get a better COMM attitude.
<br><br>
00 09 22 51        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Did you copy our recommendation on proceeding with the P52, Mike? 0ver.
<br><br>
00 09 22 58        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Negative. We didn't. I've got that in work. I'm starting on P52.

Go ahead, 11. Over.
<br><br>
00 09 36 01        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Roger. Copy our torquing angles. We're about to torque them.
<br><br>

Roger. Stand by.
<br><br>
00 09 36 08        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Roger. The reason for delay, Charlie, is that - difficult to find two stars that are not occulted by the LM and also are not in the midst of a manmade star field up here with dumps.
<br><br>
00 09 36 21        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. We copy.
<br><br>
00 09 36 38        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can torque the NOUN 93. Over.
<br><br>
00 09 36 44        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Okay.
<br><br>
00 09 40 34        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Okay, Houston. That completes the P52. We verified the third star with Antares, and AUTO optics are pointing at it pretty closely. How do our platform drift angles look so far, Charlie?
<br><br>

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We didn't have a chance to get a good check for you. We're going to run a drift check from this alignment until the next one, approximately 12 hours, and we'll have something for you later. Over.
<br><br>
00 09 41 07        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Okay.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to establish your PTC. We recommend you select quads Alfa and Delta. Over.
<br><br>
00 09 42 14        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Roger. Understand. Alfa and Delta quads.

That's affirmative.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Would you verify that the ATTITUDE SET switch is in GDC? Over.

00 09 53 06        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
The SET switch. Stand by one, Charlie.

Roger.
<br><br>

It is now.

00 09 53 14        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. It was on IMU.
<br><br>

Houston, Apollo 11. How many miles out do you have us now?
<br><br>
00 10 03 34        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
We have you - Stand by, Buzz. Roughly about 50,000. Stand by.
<br><br>

It's a beautiful sight.
<br><br>
00 10 03 46        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Charlie, on that PTC, we're just waiting our 20 minutes here for all thruster activity to damp out. You might let us know how that's coming.
<br><br>
00 10 03 54        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Will do. We have you about 48,000 miles now.

Thank you.

Hey, Charlie, I can see the snow on the mountains out in California, and it looks like LA doesn't have much of a smog problem today.
<br><br>
00 10 05 57        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger, Buzz. Copy. Looks like there's a good view out there then.
<br><br>
00 10 06 00        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
And, Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to keep the O2 fan on. It will give you an ECS configuration prior to sleep. Over.
<br><br>
00 10 06 14        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Okay. Thanks.
<br><br>
00 10 06 46        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Charlie, with the monocular, I can discern a definite green cast to the San Fernando Valley.

Roger.
<br><br>

How's Baja California look, Buzz?
<br><br>
00 10 07 07        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Well, it's got some clouds up and down it, and there's a pretty good circulation system a couple of hundred miles off the west coast of California.
<br><br>
00 10 07 21        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. 11, we'd like you to close the waste storage vent valve right now.

Okay.

Hello, Apollo ll. Houston. We'd like - The rates are looking pretty good right now on the PTC, but we'd like you to continue holding. Over.
<br><br>
00 10 09 01        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Okay. Fine.
<br><br>

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Your rates look really great, now. You can start your PTC.
<br><br>
00 10 20 33        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Okay. Thanks, Charlie.
<br><br>

Houston, you read 11?
<br><br>

00 10 21 56        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Roger. If you'd like to delay PTC after - for 10 minutes or so, we can shoot you some TV of a seven-eights earth. That's - We'll leave that up to you,
<br><br>

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'll have our answer for you on the TV in about 1 minute. Over.
<br><br>
00 10 25 56        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Apollo 11, Houston. We're ready at Goldstone for the TV. It'll be recorded at Goldstone and then replayed back over here, Neil, any time you want to turn her on, we're ready. Over.
<br><br>
00 10 26 14        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Okay. It'll take us about 5 minutes to get rigged.
<br><br>
00 10 26 16        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger.
<br><br>
00 10 26 31        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Apollo 11, Houston. Could you verify the reading on your O2 flow indicator? Over.
<br><br>
00 10 26 45        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
We're still on 0.2. We just inadvertently touched the RAPID REPRESS button. That made a temporary glitch in the flow.
<br><br>
00 10 26 55        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. During that glitch there, did it go almost a peg high? Over.
<br><br>
00 10 27 05        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
I'd believe that.
<br><br>
00 10 27 14        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Apollo 11, Houston. Could you tell us if the O2 flow indicator was pegged high prior to closing the waste storage vent valve? Over.
<br><br>
00 10 27 26        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
No, it was not.
<br><br>
00 10 27 29        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Thank you.
<br><br>
00 10 30 59        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. While ago we tracked into the scan limits and disabled the AUTO drive on the high gain. We'd like you to position the antenna at pitch 30, yaw 270, go to REACQ and that will give us narrow beamwidth. Over.
<br><br>
00 10 31 27        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
That yaw 270 and pitch 3 - What was the pitch?
<br><br>
00 10 31 32        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Pitch 30, Neil.
<br><br>
00 10 31 35        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Okay. I think we've got you.

<br><br>
00 10 32 24        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Okay, Houston. We are sending picture of Earth down right now, so you can - Let us know if they're receiving at Coldstone.
<br><br>

Roger. We're zooming in on the Earth now.
<br><br>

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Did you copy? Over.
<br><br>
00 10 34 00        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Roger. We copied, Charlie.
<br><br>
00 10 34 04        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Your transmissions the last couple of times have been about two-by. Over.
<br><br>
00 10 34 10        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Okay. How do you read me now?
<br><br>
00 10 34 11        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. You're five-by now.
<br><br>
00 10 34 12        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Okay. We're zooming the lens on in until it will just about fill the monitor.

Roger.
<br><br>
00 10 34 35        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Okay. It's in full zoom, now.
<br><br>

Copy, 11.
<br><br>
00 10 34 43        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
And how about the f-stop? Is 22 going to be accurate?
<br><br>
00 10 34 49        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Stand by. We'll get with the Goldstone TV guy. We don't have anything here at Houston. Stand by.
<br><br>
00 10 34 55        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
It looks good on the monitor, as far as the f-stop goes. Therefore, we just assumed it's okay at Goldstone.
<br><br>
00 10 35 26        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Goldstone says it - TV looks really great, five-by; we don't - The AGC looks like it's working fine. The f:22 is good; we have no real white spots. They're real pleased with it. Over.

Okay. My comments were - My comments were from Goldstone that they see no white spots as we saw in 10. Looks like the AGC's working real well. The f:22 looks good. Over.
<br><br>
00 10 36 08 <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Okay. Very good. Well, we shut out the Sun coming in from the other windows into the spacecraft, so it's looking through a - the number 1 window, and there isn't any reflected light now. So, it ought to be a pretty good picture.
<br><br>

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to keep the TV on for about 10 minutes or so, so we can get come good comparison on the camera. You can do anything your heart desires on the TV: interior, exterior, pan in and out, anything you'd like. Over.

Charlie, I'm sorry; you keep cutting out. We heard up to "you can do anything," and then after that we didn't hear anything, and we knew that wasn't right anyhow because we can't. But what do you want us to do?
<br><br>
00 10 38 21        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. We'll check this uplink on our voice. That transmission on the TV was - We'd like to get about 10 minutes worth of signal at Goldstone so we can look at the camera quality back here at Houston for about 10 minutes or so when they patch it back into us. What we were saying was that you can go interior or exterior on the camera. On the exterior shots, we'd like to look - -

Start over with, "we were saying."
<br><br>
00 10 39 36        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Okay, Houston. You suppose you could turn the Earth a little bit so we can get a little bit more than just water?
<br><br>
00 10 39 45        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger, 11. I don't think we got much control over that. Looks like you'll have to settle for the water.
<br><br>
00 10 40 01        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. We're going to change - thinking about changing our voice uplink to another site. If you'll stand by, we'll see if we can improve the quality. Over.

We'll stand by for your call.

00 10 40 48        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Apollo 11, Houston. We'll try once more on this TV request. We'd like 10 minutes worth of TV. And we'd like a narrative, if you could give us one, on the exterior shots. You could also - we also suggest you might try the - an interior position. Over.
<br><br>
00 10 41 10        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Roger. We're seeing the center of the Earth as viewed from the spacecraft in the eastern Pacific Ocean. We have not been able to visually pick up the Hawaiian Island chain, but we can clearly see the western coast of North America. The United States, the San Joaquin Valley, the High Sierras, Baja California, and Mexico down as far as Acapulco, and the Yucatan Peninsula; and you can see on through Central America to the northern coast of South America, Venezuela, and Colombia. I'm not sure you'll be able to see all that on your screen down there ...
<br><br>
00 10 42 04        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger, Neil. We just wanted a narrative such that we can - When we get the playback, we can sort of correlate what we're seeing. Thank you very much.

Roger, 11. That was a good readback. That was the block data scheduled for 12 hours. We'd like to just say that on a flight plan update here, just to remind you of some things, and you can do them at your convenience amd then go to sleep early if you'd like. We don't have anything else planned, but we'd like to just remind you on the filter change, the O2 fuel cell purge. And we'd like a LM/CM DELTA-P and accomplish the presleep checklist.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've been noting some funnies on the O2 flow indicator transducer. We've kind of got a suspicion that the transducer - We expected to see an O2 flow pegged high with the waste stowage vent to VENT. It was not. We also noted some funny indications when you closed the waste stowage vent valve. We're going to continue to take a look at this through the night, and we'll be with you in the morning with an assessment of the problem. Also, we'd like to ask specifically, when you place the waste stowage vent valve to VENT, does the detent - correction - Does the arrow line up with the detent? Over.
<br><br>

Stand by one, Charlie. We'll give you something on the detent.

Right now it's at CLOSED, and I lined up with CLOSED before I was at VENT; and best I can recall, it was quite accurately lined up with VENT. Would you like me to go to VENT again momentarily and see where it lines up?

00 11 18 49        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
It's working good so far, Charlie. We've got one installed on the water gun and the other one installed on the spigot down in the LEB, and we - mention one problem with them is that they leak at the junction between the food bag and the water filter. However, with that exception, they seem to be working pretty good. We were getting some gas through initially, and I think that was just getting the system purged out to begin with; and the last tubeful we poured was almost free of bubbles. Over.

Okay, 11. This is Houston. At time approximately 22 30 in the flight plan, in your postsleep checklist, and in all other postsleep checklists, we'd like you to delete the statement that says "AUTO RCS JET SELECT, 16 to ON," and what we're doing here is picking this up in the procedure for exiting PTC that's in your CSM checklist. And in the CSM checklist on page Foxtrot 9-8: if you want to turn to that, we'd like to change the order of the steps in that. Over.

Okay. Right now it reads, "To exit G&N PTC," then you've got a pen-and-ink change that says, "AUTO RCS SELECT, 12 MAIN A and B." And you come down to the printed step 1. We'd like to take and move the "AUTO RCS SELECT, 12 MAIN A and B" down to be the second step, so the procedure would read, "Step 1, MANUAL ATTITUDE 3, ACCEL COMMAND; Step 2 AUTO RCS SELECT, 12 MAIN A B." Step 3 would be, "Verify DAP load," and so on. Over.

Okay. From Jodrell Bank, England, via AP: Britain's big Jodrell Bank radio telescope stopped receiving signals from the Soviet Union's unmanned Moon shot at 5:49 EDT today. A spokesman said that it appeared the Luna 15 space ship "had gone beyond the Moon." Another Quote: "We don't think it has landed," said a spokesman for Sir Bernard Lovell, Director of the Observatory. Washington UPI: Vice President Spiro T. Agnew has called for putting a man on Mars by the year 2000, but Democratic leaders replied that priority must go to needs on Earth. Agnew, ranking government official at the Apollo 11 blastoff Wednesday, apparently was speaking for himself and not necessarily for the Nixon administration when he said, "We should, in my judgment, put a man on Mars by the end of this century." Laredo, Texas, AP: Immigration officials in Nuevo Laredo announced Wednesday that hippies will be refused tourist cards to enter Mexico unless they take a bath and get haircuts. Huberto Cazaras, Chief of Mexican Immigration in Nuevo Laredo, said authorities in Mexico City, Acapulco, and other popular tourist spots have registered complaints about the hippies. By United Press International: Initial reaction to President Nixon's granting of a holiday Monday to Federal employees so they can observe a national day of participation in the Apollo 11 Moon landing mission mostly was one of surprise. Rodney Bidner, Associated Press, London AP: Europe is Moon struck by the Apollo 11 mission. Newspapers throughout the continent fill their pages with pictures of the Saturn V rocket blasting off to forge Earth's first link with its natural satellite. And the headline writers taxed their imagination for words to hail the feat. "The greatest adventure in the history of humanity has started," declared the French newspaper Le Figaro, which devoted four pages to reports from Cape Kennedy and diagrams of the mission. The tabloid Paris Jour proclaimed, "The whole word tells them bravo." The Communists daily L'Humanite led with the launch picture and devoted its entire back page to an enthusiastic Moon report describing the countdown and launch, the astronauts' wives and families, and backgrounding lunar activities.

Hempstead, New York: Joe Namath officially reported to the New York Jets training camp at Hofstra University Wednesday following a closed door meeting with his teammates over his differences with pro football Commissioner Peter Rozelle. London UPI: The House of Lords was assured Wednesday that a midget American submarine would not "damage or assault" the Loch Ness monster. Lord Nomay said he wanted to be sure anyone operating a submarine in the Loch "would not subject any creatures that might inhabit it to damage or assault." He asked that the submarine's plan to take a tissue sample with a retrievable dart from any monster it finds can be done without damage and disturbance. He was told it was impossible to say if the 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act would be violated unless and until the monster found. Over.

<br><br>
00 23 57 10        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Mike, we've got some comments on performance of P23 for today if you've got a minute to talk.
<br><br>
00 23 57 20        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>

<br><br>
00 23 57 25        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Okay. For today, we'd like you on P23 to make a trunnion bias determination, prior to P23 sightings as called out in procedures, and also one afterwards. Our intent here is to check out the possibility that some sort of thermal effect may be giving you errors in the angular read-out in the sextant. The bias that you get beforehand should be incorporated, that is a PROCEED on NOUN 87 after you get two consecutive measurements equal to within 0.003 degrees. And, of course, move the trunnion off a couple of degrees between the measurements. The Earth should be a lot smaller in your field of view today. I'm , sure you're a lot more qualified to tell us about that than we are, but to ensure that you're getting a good angle measurement between the star and the Earth horizon, the sextant M-line, which is the line that runs through the two hash marks and is perpendicular to the R-line, should be parallel to the Earth horizon at the substellar point. And then the actual superimposition of the star upon the horizon can be made at any point in the field of view of the sextant: above, below, or on the M-line. We recommend the marks be made as rapidly as possible after AUTO maneuver. If you feel that the amount of time between the AUTO maneuver and the time you get ready to mark is excessive, or that you don't like that AUTO maneuver attitude when you get ready to mark, of course, you can use a VERB 94 - VERB 94 to get you back to the flashing 51 position to redo the AUTO maneuvers.

<br><br>
01 00 02 13        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Okay. We're stopping PTC now and maneuvering to our P52 and optics CAL attitude. In regard to that P23, what I was trying to tell you yesterday was about that. The M-line is not anywhere parallel to the horizon at the roll, pitch, and yaw which you gave me to go to for the substellar point, and I was trying to maneuver off to get it parallel to the horizon when you all said that was not necessary.
<br><br>
01 00 02 47        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger, 11. I guess in keeping the cups of coffee score, why you get that one.
<br><br>
01 00 02 57        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Well - Okay - Well, this morning, let's just see how close it comes to being parallel to the M-line. Before we started marking for the first time, it appeared that the computation of - of those three angles was somewhat off, and that I was wasting a lot of gas by going to those three angles and then having to make large attitude changes after that to get the M-line parallel. In some cases it appeared to be just an accepted attitude required, and you all said that it wasn't needed. So I was marking in some cases with the M-line not parallel. I thought perhaps you had some processor for computing that offset and making sense out of that data, but as far as I know, we've got to have the M-line parallel to the horizon.
<br><br>
01 00 03 49        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger, 11. We don't have that capability. We do require that the M-line be parallel to the horizon in order to get a good mark. We feel that possibly the - the state vector information that you were using for your maneuver basis yesterday may have needed to be updated a little. And if you'll standby a second, we'll give you an evaluation of what we feel you'll get today by the AUTO maneuver.

Roger. I'm in a good attitude here to do - I have in the sextant this last P52 star, star 37. Is that all right for the optics calibration to save some gas, or do you want to go over to star 40?
<br><br>
01 00 24 23        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Star 37 will be fine for the optics calibration. And we haven't noticed a VERB 66, yet, after our state vector uplink. Over.

When you move into P23, we recommend that you use the CMC-computed angles for your AUTO maneuver and see how that works out. If it doesn't bring you up with the M-line parallel to the horizon to the substellar point, we will see if we can get you some ground-computed angles. I guess the big thing here is to make sure that the M-line is parallel to substellar points so we can get a good angular measurement. Over.

Well, of course, the Earth is pretty bright, and the black sky, instead of being black, has sort of a rosy glow to it. The star, unless it is a very bright one, is probably lost somewhere in that glow, but it is just not visible. I maneuvered the reticle considerably above the horizon to make sure that the star is not lost in the brightness below the horizon. However, even when I get the reticle considerably above the horizon so the star should be seen against the black background, it still is not visible.

On our ground computers we confirm the shaft and trunnion angle that you have as being pointed at the star. However, it looks as though that shaft and trunnion angle is also pointing into the structure of the LM, so that while you will be getting the Earth's horizon, the star ... is obscured by the LM. We recommend an AUTO maneuver to the attitudes pen-and-inked into the flight plan. Roll 1772, pitch 2982 and yaw 330.0. Over.

That's right. I - I haven't entered - I gave the - I gave it back to the computer for a second. I put the mode switch from MANUAL back to CMC while I fooled with the DSKY, and the computer drove the star off out of sight. So the delay here has been in going back to MANUAL and finding the star again, which I've finally done. And - Just a second here, I'll go to ENTER and get a 51 and mark on it.

01 03 18 27        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Yes, It would be nicer if it had another order of magnitude of power on it. Of course, it has a tendency to jiggle around a little bit, and you might want to have some sort of a bracket. I hate to use that word though.

I've got a comment about the point on the Earth where the Sun's rays reflect back up toward us. In general, the color of the oceans is mostly uniform and it's bright and darker blue except for that region that's about one-eighth of an Earth's radius in diameter; and in this circular area, the blue of the water turns a grayish color, and I'm sure that's where the Sun's rays are being reflected back on up toward us. Over.
<br><br>
01 03 22 41        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger, Buzz. We noticed the same thing. It's very similar to looking at a light shining on something like a billiard ball or a bowling ball. You get this bright spot in the blue of the water, and that turns it to sort of a grayish color.
<br><br>
01 03 22 57        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Yes. Is there a Navy term for that?

Mike, are you satisfied with P23 now?
<br><br>
01 03 25 43        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Yes, I'm happy with the last updates we got, you know, in terms of what it did to our state vector. Still not altogether happy with the various procedures. If we could pick stars within the smaller range of trunnion angles so that you could allow P23 to pick its own maneuver and go to that substellar point and then have that star visible, that would seem to me to be the simplest and best way to do it.

Looks like the best way to get a steady view through the monocular is just steady it out and let it close when it's in front of your eye, and then you kind of float up next to it so that you're not touching it at all. It has a very slow drift, and you get a better - steadier view that way.

Jim, it's been a little warm in the machine throughout yesterday and last night during the PTC. It cooled off somewhat with the windows buttoned up, and we've seen suit temperatures of about - the high 40's and cabin temperatures in the low 60's. But this seems to be still a little bit on the warm side.
<br><br>
01 03 29 28        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
I understand that it got a little warm during the day and cooled down a little bit when you put the shades up, but you're still a little bit warm. Do you have any moisture condensation or anything like that on the wall?
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 18/8 Page 87
<br><br>
01 03 29 40        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
No, we haven't been able to detect any moisture anyplace in the spacecraft. It seems to be fine.
<br><br>
01 03 29 50        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
One of the hydrogen filters - the one that we've got on the hot water - seems to keep flowing when you remove one of the food bags from it. Its flow rate is quite small, right near the end of one out, and that contributes a little bit of moisture to the atmosphere.
<br><br>
01 03 30 16        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Yes, that hydrogen thing, it's - I'm not sure, but I think it's a backpressure problem. If the thing sees any backpressure at all, like when the bag is attached, well the flow rate will slowly decrease to where it's almost zero, and you wait, and you wait, and you wait for that last ounce. You think you have its and you remove the bag, and then you very rapidly thereafter see maybe a glob the size of a dime or a quarter come out and just hang there. That appears to be true even though the opening into the bag is not restricted.
<br><br>
01 03 30 49        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Understand.
<br><br>
01 03 30 54        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
In general, I think they do quite a good job, especially on the guns, in removing a lot of the hydrogen bubbles.
<br><br>
01 03 31 04        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Have the water temperatures been good? Are you getting hot water?

Yes. It seems reasonably warm.

We made three cups of coffee today. The last one - you know when all the plumbing was warmed up, the hydrogen gun and everything, was warmest of the three. I don't know who had that one - Neil, did you have that one? How was your coffee? You didn't drink it till later, did you? Anyway, it's pretty good. It's not piping hot, but it sure beats stone-cold coffee.

However, we still need about 2 hours' worth of cabin enrichment, so we'd like to keep the vent that we're going to set up going for this purpose. Okay. We want you to install the cabin vent quick disconnect which you'll find in compartment R-6, that is Romeo 6, on the urine connector on panel 251.

Well, right now, after we put that gadget in, we've got it back to 0.35. Before that, we were reading on scale level. I think ours is relatively correct, at least when time comes for the water accumulator to kick in at 10 seconds, it goes on up to about 0.75, 0.8, something like that.

And, 11, this is Houston. A little more information based on our analysis of your last SPS burn: it looks like you got a good solid burn there. We show 94 psi chamber pressure and it looks like the SPS is definitely GO. Over.

Okay. Bruce, we're coming up on the water accumulator activity, and it's going on up to 0.85, oh, about 0.95 and it reached a peak there and then gradually dropped back on down to 0.6 now, 0.4, and it looks like it's pretty well - pretty well leveling off back down to 0.35. Over.

Roger. On that 2O flow transducer down here on telemetry, our values are agreeing pretty well with what you read out onboard, and the EECOMM's have been noticing this cycle, but it still looks like the indicated rate is lower than what we would expect. We're still working on the problem, and we'll let you have a more complete diagnosis on it in a little while.

Roger, 11. We've been watching your activity on the DSKY there, and by selecting another major program with a VERB 37 ENTER and all that, we show you collapsing the deadband in PTC and having driven the CMC rate from 0.3 degrees per second down to 0 degrees per second, although of course, with all the AUTO RCS coils shut off, you're not firing any thrusters. 0ver.

Okay. What do you recommend?
<br><br>
01 05 32 59        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Well, you can just continue in your present configuration in PTC. However, if you go to turn any thrusters on, the CMC would then try to bring you into an attitude hold position rather than continuing with the PTC. Over.

And, Houston, we're just looking at you out our window here. Looks like there's a circulation of clouds that just moved east of Houston over the Gulf and Florida area. Did that have any rain in it this morning?
<br><br>
01 05 33 59        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

Yes. Well, it looks like it ought to clear up pretty soon from our viewpoint. The western edge of the weather isn't wery far west of you.

Go ahead, Houston.
<br><br>
01 05 58 23        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, this is Houston. As a result of our venting through the waste management drain, we've concluded that your O2 flow rate sensor is, in fact, malfunctioning. I mentioned when you talked us through the cyclic water accumulator dump that even though it was moving, probably indicating a higher flow rate, it didn't seem to be indicating a flow rate that is high enough; and based on that and the flow that we're getting right now, we've concluded that the transducer is malfunctioning. We'd like to continue the O2 flow for about another hour, shutting it off at about 31 hours GET, to get the O2 concentration in the vehicles up to - in the vehicles up to where it will be acceptable for LM checkout. Over.
<br><br>
01 05 59 27        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Okay. Does it look to you like it just has a bias on it?
<br><br>
01 05 59 45        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger, 11. It does seem to be a bias. Looks like it has a fairly high threshold before it starts indicating. EECOMM seems to think, though, that for high flow rate purposes, it will still give you a relative indication during the mission. Over.
<br><br>

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. The Goldstone TV guys say they have some horizontal banding across the upper part of the picture and across the lower part. They would consider the lines just straight, no waviness to them at all. Over.
<br><br>
01 07 02 24        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Roger. Understand. They do seem to distort vertical lines though.
<br><br>
01 07 02 30         <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Say again about the vertical lines, Buzz.
<br><br>
01 07 02 35        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Roger. When there's a vertical line, these horizontal bands tend to put small waves in it.
<br><br>
01 07 02 44        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. I copy. He didn't mention that. Stand by, I'll check again.
<br><br>
01 07 03 30        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Hello, 11. Houston. The Goldstone TV said that when you get a sharp vertical line on the picture, when the horizontal banding goes across, it does appear to bend it slightly. The same as Apollo 10, they said. Looks okay to them. Over.
<br><br>
01 07 03 47        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>

Okay. Well, for this TV program coming up in a couple of hours, you might give some thought to how you want us to stop PTC, if you do, for the best high gain angle; and also it would be nice if you could stop us at such an attitude that we'd have the Earth out of one of our windows.

Roger, 11. Your TV attitude will be roll 261, pitch 090, yaw 000. High gain angle: pitch plus 28, yaw 271. That puts the left-hand window pointed at the Earth. We recommend exiting PTC with your updated procedure in the checklist. Over.

Charlie, Apollo 11. I have a couple of questions on stopping the PTC. It seems to me the easiest way to stop it would be - we're essentially, of course, at 0 degrees yaw and closing up to 90 degrees pitch, so it's just a question of stopping at 260 roll, roughly, and - How about for a procedure going MANUAL ATTITUDE, three to RATE COMMAND and then, seeing as how our deadband has already collapsed, I'll turn on the panel 8 RCS thrusters, at which time it should stop at whatever attitude it finds itself in. And if I do all of that as it comes up on 261 degrees roll, we should stop right there. Is that sufficient?

Roger, Mike. We'd like to see you go to ACCEL COMMAND on the MANUAL ATTITUDE switches. Then to turn on the AUTO RCS SELECT switches, and then go RATE COMMAND. That will prevent us from firing jets uncoupled. Over.
<br><br>
01 08 33 36        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Okay. Fine. And I would guess go RATE COMMAND and roll first and then followed by pitch and yaw.
<br><br>
01 08 33 45        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Okay. That sounds good if - And when you get to the roll attitude desired, just go RATE COMMAND at that time and it'll stop us right on.

<br><br>
01 08 39 20        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Mike, when you were playing with the P37 a while ago and we collapsed the deadband back down, the DAP assumed that the deadband was centered around the new attitude that we happened to be at, at that time. Since then, we've drifted out a couple of degrees in both pitch and yaw from that attitude such that if we did the procedure as we called it up to you of going ACCEL COMMAND, turning on all of the AUTO RCS SELECT switches and then RATE COMMAND, it would attempt to fly back to the pitch and yaw attitude that it had when the deadband collapsed. We can prevent that by - just immediately prior to going to RATE COMMAND on the MANUAL ATTITUDE switches, if you cycle the SPACECRAFT CONTROL switch to SCS, then back to CMC. Over.

Yes. As usual.

Roger. The - around -
<br><br>
01 08 50 29        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
It looks like there's some clouds just to the west of the Sierras, northeast of Bakersfield a little bit; and crossing over into the Mojave from Bakersfield looks clear; and then as you get on further to the southeast of there, there's a few clouds.
<br><br>

Roger, 11. Can you pick out Edwards in the sextant? Over.
<br><br>
01 08 50 58        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
I can see a 104 taxiing out for takeoff on the runway.
<br><br>

Hey, man. That's super.
<br><br>
01 08 51 07        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
These dang bastards almost always have a 104 taxiing out for takeoff.
<br><br>
01 08 51 48        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. Could you pick out anything around Edwards, a dry lake or anything? Over.
<br><br>
01 08 51 56        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Negative, Charlie. I just - I don't have that resolution. But to give you some idea, I can - on the lower Texas coast, I can see - knowing what I'm looking for, I can see Padre Island. I can just barely make out the fact that there's a thin spit of land and then there's a little dark zone which is the Laguna Madre between it and the mainland.

Roger, 11. That's pretty significant. Thank you much, Buzz.
<br><br>
01 08 52 27        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Right.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.
<br><br>
01 09 37 48        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Go ahead, Charlie.

01 09 37 50        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Latest on Luna 15 - TASS reported this morning that the spacecraft was placed in orbit close to the lunar surface, and everything seems to be functioning normally on the vehicle. Sir Bernard Lovell said the craft appears to be in an orbit of about 62 nautical miles. Over.
<br><br>
01 09 38 17        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Okay. Thank you, Charlie.
<br><br>
01 09 38 20        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
And also, President Nixon has reported - or declared a day of participation on Monday for all federal employees to enable everybody to follow your activities on the surface. Many state and city governments and businesses throughout the country are also giving their employees the day off, so it looks like you're going to have a pretty large audience for the EVA.
<br><br>
01 09 38 46        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Oh, that's very nice, Charlie. I'll tell Neil about it.

Houston, Apollo 11. We've stopped PTC. We're in the right position; we're setting up for TV.

Apollo 11, Houston. We have you stopped in the PTC; attitude looks good to us. Mike, I would like to get a COMM check. The last couple of the transmissions from the spacecraft has been garbled from especially Buzz. Could you both give me a COMM check? Over.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We got the network all configured for the TV. You can start any time you want. Over.
<br><br>
01 09 59 45        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Okay, 11. We have a picture. We see the Earth right in the center of the screen. Over.
<br><br>
01 09 59 52        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Roger, Houston. Apollo 11 calling in from about 130,000 miles out. And we'll zoom our camera in slowly and get the most magnification we can. Over.
<br><br>
01 10 00 06        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger.
<br><br>
01 10 01 16        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. The definition is pretty good on our monitor here. The color is not too ..., at least on this set. Could you describe what you're looking at? Over.
<br><br>
01 10 01 31        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Roger. You're seeing Earth, as we see it, out our left-hand window, just a little more than a half Earth. We're looking at the eastern Pacific Ocean, and the north half of the top half of the screen, we can see North America, Alaska, United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America. South America becomes invisible just off beyond the terminator or inside the shadow. We can see the oceans with a definite blue cast, see white bands of major cloud formations across the Earth, and can see coastlines, pick out the western U.S., San Joaquin Valley, the Sierra mountain range, the peninsula of Baja California, and we can see some cloud formations over southeastern U.S. There's one definite mild storm southwest of Alaska, looks like about 500 to 1000 miles, and another very minor storm showing the south end of the screen near the - or a long ways off of the equator, probably 45 degrees or more south latitude. Can pick out the browns in the landforms pretty well. Greens do not show up very well. Some greens showing along the northeastern - northwestern coast of the United States and northwestern coast of Canada.
<br><br>
01 l0 03 44        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger, 11. It's a pretty good picture on clarity here. We're having - can you tell us - It appears to us that there are two distinct cloud- formations
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 22/3 Page 109
<br><br>
trending east/west, one approximately about along the equator, and one around 30 or so south latitude. Could you tell us exactly where those cross the landmasses? Over.
<br><br>
01 10 04 13        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Yes. They cross just south of the lower part of Mexico, probably through Central America. That is the equatorial band which we assume to be the intertropical convergence zone. The other band, which stands about 30 south, correctly appears to join the equator at the far left, or just beyond the horizon on the left edge of Earth, or at least it looks like it's going to join it. We don't have an explanation for that banding.
<br><br>
01 10 04 53        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger, Neil. Thank you. It also appears that just to the left of the terminator, up in the northern hemisphere, there's a cloudband trending - a gap in the cloud, trending northwest/southeast. It appears to us that that comes in about over the northern United States, or perhaps the central United States. Is that about correct? Over.
<br><br>
01 10 05 26        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
I can see on the monitor the thing you were talking about, but right now I can't get my eye to the window to pick out just where it crosses the shoreline.
<br><br>
01 10 05 35        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger.
<br><br>
01 10 05 42        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
You guys are doing a good job. It's a real steady picture, here. We're - Clarity is excellent. The color, it's - the clouds are - The whites are distinct. The rest if it looks like, to me anyway on the monitor I'm observing, is a fairly greenish blue is the way I'd describe it. Over.
<br><br>
01 10 06 09        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
It appears that the - -
<br><br>
01 10 06 11        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Well, we can't observe much green from the spacecraft.
<br><br>
01 10 06 18        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. On this monitor, the landmasses appear to be just a darker grayish color rather than a brown.
<br><br>
01 10 06 31        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Well, it's true that we do not have the depths of color at this range that we enjoyed at 50,000 miles out. However, the oceans still are a definite blue and the continents are generally brownish in cast,
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 22/4 Page 110
<br><br>
although it is true that they're tending more toward gray now than they were at the closer range.
<br><br>
01 10 07 03        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger, 11. We've been - I've just been vectored to another monitor and sure enough, the browns are coming in a lot more distinctly on the Eidephor that we have up on our screen in the control center. Over.
<br><br>
01 10 07 21        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Okay, world, hold on to your hat. I'm going to turn you upside-down.

Oh, I'd say sloppy, Charlie. Let me try that one again.

<br><br>
01 10 08 43        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Oops! Spoke too soon.
<br><br>
01 10 08 53        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
I'm making myself seasick doing it, Charlie. I'll just put you back rightside-up where you belong.

You don't get to do that every day.
<br><br>
01 10 09 32        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. Could you describe, from your view, the polar cloudcap? It appears to us to extend down the western coast of North America. Would you estimate how far it extends down? Over.
<br><br>
01 10 09 47        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Trying to fit everybody into the window.
<br><br>
01 10 09 50        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
It appears that the cloudcap comes down a little bit below the southern extremity of Alaska.

<br><br>
01 10 10 24        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Okay. Apollo 11, Houston. We've got the picture back now.

01 10 10 36        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Unfortunately, we only have one window that has a view of the Earth and it's filled up with the TV camera, so your view now is probably better than ours is.

Roger. We copy.
<br><br>
01 10 10 51        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. If you could comply, we'd like to see a little smiling faces up there, if you could give us some interior views. I'm sure everybody would like to see you. Over.
<br><br>
01 10 11 06        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Okay. We'll reconfigure the TV for that.

Roger.
<br><br>
01 10 12 31        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Apollo 11, Houston. It appears to us that we're seeing a view from outside plus a little of the inside. It appears you've taken the camera away from the left window now. Over.
<br><br>
01 10 12 45        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
That's correct. We're moving it back and reconfiguring for interior lighting.

Roger.
<br><br>
01 10 12 56        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
We can still see the Earth through the left window, and it appears that we can see a floodlight off to the left, either that or some Sun shafting through the hatch window.
<br><br>
01 10 13 10        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
It's a floodlight.

Is Buzz holding your cue cards for you. Over.
<br><br>
01 10 14 25        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Cue cards have a no. We have no intertions of competing with the professionals, believe me. We are very comfortable up here, though. We do have a happy home. There's plenty of room for the three of us and I think we're all learning to find our favorite little corner to sit in. Zero g is very comfortable, but after a while you get to the point where you sort of get tired of rattling around and banging off the ceiling and the floor and the side, so you tend to find a little corner somewhere and put your knees up or something like that to wedge yourself in, and that seems more at home.
<br><br>
01 10 15 05        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Looks like Neil is coming in five-by there, 11. Mike, see you in the background. The definition is really outstanding. The colors are good. It's a real good picture we're getting here of Commander Armstrong. We - Buzz, when you take the camera over towards the window where the Sun's shafting through, it tends to blank it out, though.
<br><br>
01 10 15 35        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Yes, Neil's standing on his head again. He's trying to make me nervous.

While we're pointing up in this direction, we see out our side windows the Sun going by and, of course, out one of our windows right now we've got the Earth. Now right behind my window, of course, we have the Sun, because the Sun is illuminating the star charts that we see. This line represents the ecliptic plane and these lines, vertical lines, represent our reference system that the spacecraft is using at this time. As we approach the Moon, the Moon will gradually grow larger and larger in size and eventually it will

be in - it will be eclipsing the Sun as we go behind it, as we approach the lunar orbit insertion maneuver.

<br><br>
01 10 20 01        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. That's a lot better on the star chart now. We can make out the ecliptic plane and the planets and the Sun and the Moon as they have gone at various places throughout the ecliptic plane. Over.

We really have them, Charlie. We've got all kinds of good stuff. We've got coffee up here in the upper left and various breakfast items, bacon in little small bites, beverages like fruit drink, and over in the center part we have, oh, all kinds of things. Let me pull one out here and see what it is.

Would you believe you're looking at chicken stew, here? All you have to do is - 3 ounces of hot water for 5 or 10 minutes. Now we get our hot water out of a little spigot up here with a
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 22/9 Page 115
<br><br>
filter on it that filters any gases that may be in the drinking water out, and we just stick the end of this little tube in the end of the spigot and pull the trigger three times for 3 ounces of hot water and then mush it up and slice the end off it and there you go, beautiful chicken stew.
<br><br>

<br><br>
01 10 24 44        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Well, the problem is, no matter how carefully you let go, you bump it just a tiny little bit and set it in motion, and once in motion there she goes. Try that again.
<br><br>
01 10 25 00        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

The colors are - now, it's really an excellent picture now that I'm looking at it on our monitor, which is about 12 seconds before the networks can get it out due to the conversion that we have here on our TV converter. We're looking at the controls in the main display console. We can see the DSKY up on the panel. Over.

Roger, 11. The problem on that initially - starting up the PTC was we failed to do the VERB 49 which - and load the desired initial attitude; so the DAP tried to take it back to the old attitude that we had started up in number of hours to go. That's why we picked up the rates in the other axes. We're going to wait in this attitude for about 20 minutes to dump out the rates again, and than we'll proceed with the VERB 49 and load our attitude that we have at the time - at this time. Over.

Roger. We've finally gotten concurrence on our problem here with 50 guys looking at it. When we were sitting in the 5018, we attempted to load the erasable before you terminated the VERB 49.

Roger. Mike, I think we can explain that seventenths rate. When we - the first time through, you know, we failed to go through the VERB 49, so we had a large error between our actual CDU and desired CDU in roll. And with that situation,
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 24/2 Page 128

the DAP - the vehicle will roll - will maneuver, rather, at a rate that is loaded in, which was three-tenths plus four-tenths rate, and it will limit at four-tenths above the desired rate, so - that is if we have a large enough angle between the desired and the actual, which we did. So, therefore, the rate was four tenths plus three tenths to give you the seven tenths. Over.

Roger, 11. We'd like to perform a waste-water dump at your convenience some time in the near future here. No particular time scheduled. Down air at the time for midcourse correction 3, which is about 53 55, we're deleting midcourse correction number 3 and all the items associated with it. For your information, the calculated value of the burn for midcourse number 3 was eight tenths of a foot per second, that is 0.8 feet per second. Canceling this, if we decide to burn midcourse correction 4, this would then give you a burn for midcourse correction 4 of 2.0 feet per second. At 53 hours we have an IMU realign P52. We're requesting that you do this while in PTC, and we plan to continue PTC throughout the day. Over.

Houston, Apollo 11. We've got the continent of Africa ... facing toward us right now, and of course, everything's getting smaller and smaller as time goes on. The Mediterranean is completely clear. The Sun looks like it's about to set around Madagascar. The equatorial belt of Africa stands out quite clearly. We're seeing the dark green or a muddy colored green, compared to the sandier colors in the southern tip of Africa and, of course, the Sahara northern coast of Africa. There's a rather remarkable cloud that appears in the vicinity of the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. It's just about to go into the sunset now. It is casting quite a large shadow. It's isolated. There don't seem to be any other clouds ... the band of clouds near the tropical conversions clouds down around the equator clearly separate the clockwise and the counterclockwise cloud formations. Over.
<br><br>
02 00 33 57        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger, 11. We copy your word description on that. I understand you can see a shadow being cast by that cloud over between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Any estimate on how long that shadow would be? Over.

02 00 34 33        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
We're getting a lot of background noise now, also. If you will stand by a minute or so until we roll a little further in PTC, I think things will get better.
<br><br>

<br><br>
02 00 37 26        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Okay. We copy the width of the Persian Gulf, and I guess that all I can give you firsthand is a single isolated data point, and that is that it was clear here in Houston this morning. That's a pretty localized observation. As a result of your waste water dump, it looks like the PTC mode has been disturbed somewhat. We're showing you about 20 degrees out in pitch right now and about 6 degrees in yaw, which is significantly greater, about twice as much - a little more than twice as much as the deviation you had prior to the waste water dump. We' re watching it down here, though, and we'll let you know if we think any corrective action is required. Over.
<br><br>
02 00 38 14        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Okay. Maybe we ought to - next time split that in half, and put half of it on one side and half on the other or something like that.
<br><br>
02 00 38 25        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Yes. We could do that. We were actually pretty interested in seeing what the effect on PTC would be of the waste water dump. We don't recall ever having performed a waste water dump during PTC on previous missions. Over.

<br><br>
02 00 45 55        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Roger. It came through a lot clearer through the sextant than with the monocular, and you could definitely tell it was one single cell in the latter stages of development. It must have gone up to over 50,000 feet, though. The eastern Mediterranean is phenomenally clear. You can see all the lakes; the Dead Sea stood out quite well. Over.

Roger, Buzz. How about the telescope? Is it useful now?
<br><br>
02 00 57 02        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Well, it's not quite as useful; it never seems to be. Depending on the position of the Sun, it's got that band that seems to go across the center. I don't think it's because of the waste water particles that it would lack its effectiveness. Over.
<br><br>
02 00 57 22        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

The Sun bounces off the LM structure. With the LM attached, that telescope is just about useless. Those star charts that MPAD provided us, I think, would be most useful if we had to use the - if for some reason we had to mark through the telescope. We could use those as a guide for what we're looking at and say, "Well, that bright blob over there has got to be that star because that's the position we're in." But so far, we've not been able to pick out any decent star patterns while docked with the LM using the telescope.

That is, it's probably what we would expect from a transducer that's malfunctioning probably in this fashion, and it's just going to keep on getting worse like that. Nothing to worry about. We'll monitor things on the ground here. Over.

In Austin, State Representative Ray Lemmon of Houston has been nominated as the National Director of the American Society for Oceanography. Lemmon has proposed a study of the possibility of establishing an institute of oceanography in Texas. This would be the first such institute on the western Gulf of Mexico.

In Minneapolis, Minnesota, the weather bureau, after recapping today's weather showing a high of 88 and a low of 72, has noted "snowfall: none." From St. Petersburg, Florida, comes a radio report from the Norwegian explorer, Thor Heyerdahl, which said that the crew of his papyrus boat, the Ra, will sail into Bridgetown, Barbados, despite damage from heavy seas. The crew, however, will sleep on an escort vessel. Norman Baker, navigator of the expedition, said the crew was aboard the Ra today repairing damage from storms this past week, which split the footing of the mast. Part of the broken mast was jettisoned overboard, and the vessel was 725 miles east of the Barbados. "It is possible but uncomfortable to sleep aboard the Ra," Baker said in the radio report. "But the purpose of our voyage is not a test of strength or human endurance." That is the reason why the crew was spending nights aboard the escort vessel Shenandoah, which rendezvoused with the Ra on Tuesday.

American League: we have Baltimore 3, over Cleveland 2; Detroit 4 to Washington's 3; Minnesota 8 to Chicago 5. Boston at New York was rained out.

<br><br>
02 05 58 40        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Well, that's intermittently affirmative, Bruce. We have these two hydrogen filters, which work fine as long as you don't hook them up to a food bag. But the entry way into the food bag has enough back pressure to cause the - the filters to start losing their efficiency. A couple of times, I've been tempted to go through that dryout procedure, but we found that simply by leaving the filters alone for a couple of hours, their efficiency seems to be restored.
<br><br>
02 05 59 14        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. We copy.
<br><br>
02 05 59 23        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Their efficiency ranges anywhere from darn near perfect to terrible just depending on the individual characteristics of the food bags we're putting through them. Some of the food bags are so crimped near the entry-way that there's no way we can work them loose to prevent back pressure.

Roger, 11. As you've probably noticed, your coning angle in PTC mode is increased substantially as a result of the waste water dump, the fuel cell purge, and a natural coupling, so it looks like we are going to have to terminate PTC here in a little while. And we'd like to get your feeling as to whether you're still anticipating trying to send back TV signals from inside the LM; and if so, we'll try to provide an attitude that you can hold that'll give us high gain antenna lock on the Earth during the TV and LM activation period.

<br><br>
02 06 39 35        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Okay. We recommend stopping PTC at GET of 54 45 00, and this should put you at just about the right roll angle. The attitude we recommend is roll 263, pitch 090, yaw 000. This gives you the Earth out of window number 1 in the command module and places the high gain antenna in the CSM window for TV at your convenience. You will also have the Sun shining in - or shining at the hatch on the LM, and if you take down the window shades you should get some sunlight in. We're recommending wide deadband. Over.

Alright. Can you hear our master alarm in the background? That's O2 FLOW HIGH coming through this amplifier.

<br><br>
02 06 53 50        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
I say that photoelectric cell amplifier for the master alarm is a good device. It's working very well, and it's a nice pleasing tone.

Houston, Apollo 11. As a matter of curiosity, our O2 flow meter is pegged FULL-SCALE HIGH.
<br><br>
02 06 55 08        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger, 11. We copy that here. Over.
<br><br>

Okay.

02 06 55 26        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Boy, that transducer's working somewhat.

Roger.
<br><br>
02 06 55 51        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. We'd like to try to attempt to correlate your O2 flow in transducer with the flow valve that you've got open. How far - How far open would you say you have the REPRESS O2? 0ver. Correction, the DIRECT O2.
<br><br>
02 06 56 10        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Stand by, Charlie.
<br><br>
02 06 56 19        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Okay, Charlie. It's not open very far. It's hard to give you a good reading without shunting it again, but the arrow is at about the one o'clock position. Now I reduce the flow, and I'll let it stabilize here. Right now our onboard reading is about 0.4, and that's with the arrow in the O2 valve at the two o'clock position. Would you rather have comparisons of O2 flow readings or would you rather have valve position comparisons?

<br><br>
02 06 57 01        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Okay. Well, we're holding steady now at 0.3 pound per hour, and our cabin pressure is about 54; and I'll close the valve momentarily and then open it again to this position and tell you how much travel is required.
<br><br>
02 06 57 18        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger.
<br><br>
02 06 57 29        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
It's about 30 degrees of travel, Charlie, from the closed position, which is with the arrow pointing at about three to three-thirty, four o'clock.

Houston, Apollo 11. We've terminated direct O2, our cabin pressure is 57, and, as a matter of curiosity, when we turn the DIRECT O2 valve OFF, we get a master alarm just like they did in the spacecraft testing.

02 07 20 10        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

Well, that may be good in some respects, but -
<br><br>
02 07 40 22        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
We had a view, Buzz, of the utility light cord. ...
<br><br>

Now let me show you a view looking the other way.
<br><br>
02 07 40 33        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. And we see right now the utility light or either the floodlight up there.
<br><br>
02 07 40 45        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
I think now I see the utility light still in the stowage bag. Hey, that's a great shot right there. We see you in there. Guess that's Neil and Mike. Better be, anyway.
<br><br>
02 07 41 13        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
We see you waving.

<br><br>
02 07 41 46        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

<br><br>
02 07 41 55        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Just saying hello. On the LCG sight gage, you got about - oh, it looks like the white mark that's in the plunger is about a quarter to three-eighths inch out into the green away from the red. Is that what you'd like to see? Over.
<br><br>
02 07 42 18        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Stand by. Roger, Buzz. That looks good to us. Thank you much.
<br><br>
02 07 42 28        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
It is the white index, is it not, that you're interested in comparing whether it's in the red or green?
<br><br>
02 07 42 34        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Stand by. That's affirmative, Buzz. It looks good. That's a good reading for us. Over.

Okay.

<br><br>
02 07 43 24        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. That's a real good view we have of the AOT. You're back now, Buzz, and notice you're taking down one of the window shades. Over.

The light is superb.
<br><br>
02 07 43 37        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
How's the Sun coming in? How's the Sun coming in from this direction going to affect what you can see?
<br><br>
02 07 43 44        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
It made it really super. The lighting is excellent in the - in the LM right now. We can make out the AOT, the ISA, and the left-hand window - there's a little glare off of that, but the LMP side the - with the shade down it's really excellent. Over.
<br><br>
02 07 44 08        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Well, let's - I'm turned around, why I took the shade off my side first.

<br><br>
02 07 44 29        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Yes, the lighting in the LM is very nice now, just like completely daylight; and everything is visible. A good bit lighter than the tunnel was earlier.
<br><br>
02 07 44 43        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. We got a good view now, Neil, of the DEDA; and also Buzz's ACA.
<br><br>

<br><br>
02 07 45 44        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. We see you removing the ISA now, folding it up, putting it up on the AOT. The instrument panels are coming into view behind.
<br><br>
02 07 45 58        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Yes, I think it'd probably be best, since we've done SPS burn, to put it back over the instrument panel instead of putting it up over the PLSS on the recharge station. Would you care to comment on that one? We could do either just as easily.
<br><br>
02 07 46 12        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

<br><br>
02 07 47 17        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

<br><br>
02 07 47 23        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Now you know how we feel.
<br><br>
02 07 47 30        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Okay. Neil's OPS is about 57, 5800.

No, that's mine.
<br><br>
02 07 48 40        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. That moment - a moment ago, we had a good shot of your PLSS, Buzz, and the two helmet stowage bags. Down behind your left shoulder, Buzz, we have the - the DSKY and the ACA.

<br><br>
02 07 51 09        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Yes, unfortunately it looks like it's down a little bit more towards ... than I can be able to see in the AOT.

I can read the letters on the hatch cover. It's a boost cover release; and the big yellow arrow that points toward the opening - place where the tool B goes.

Apollo 11, Houston. Neil, at this attitude you look like you're about 12 feet long.
<br><br>
02 08 11 34        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
It seems like I always find myself upside-down in whatever I'm doing around here.
<br><br>
02 08 12 29        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Apollo 11, Houston. Could you give us a few comments on your crew comfort with the CSM hoses moving the air around? Over.
<br><br>
02 08 12 42        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Well, it's picking up a little bit on circulation in here.
<br><br>
02 08 12 47        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
What do you estimate the temperature is, Buzz? Over.
<br><br>
02 08 12 57        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Oh, I'd say maybe 73, 75.

It's hard to tell at this density and pressure of gas, but comfort level is about the - about the same as the command module.

02 08 16 32        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
No, what's happening is, we get pretty close to the window now and then, and it drives the automatic light control into the stop, I think.
<br><br>
02 08 16 42        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
I think that's right.
<br><br>
02 08 16 51        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Yes, I had the switch on OUTSIDE while I was going through the overhead window. That may be what's contributing to some of it.

<br><br>
02 08 17 17        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Yes, I'm choking on one every so often.
<br><br>
02 08 17 41        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. Your show is going out to the U.S. now. We're about to get the satellite up. It'll be transmitted to some other countries after that. Over.

Apollo 11, Houston. We keep marveling about the color and the clarity of the picture. It's really difficult to describe. It's - It's just perfect. Over.

02 08 18 31        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
And, 11, it doesn't look like you're having too much trouble with that bracket up there, Buzz.
<br><br>
02 08 18 41        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
I'll tell you, those new knobs really make it easy to twist the thing and get it cinched down quite tight.

<br><br>
02 08 20 13        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
It looks pretty good, as well as I can tell without the gear extended. I can't get a real definitive answer, but you couldn't fix it any place to see much more out of the window without hand-holding it for the whole time.
<br><br>
02 08 20 29        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

<br><br>
02 08 24 28        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Our monitor shows pretty good, clear pictures from this angle. I already found the 90-degree bracket.
<br><br>
02 08 24 37        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger, Neil. It's really a super picture. We've got the ACA, your ACA, the picture of the throttle, the 90-degree bracket. We see your handles, and now over to the bracket.
<br><br>
02 08 25 25        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
That's about the position we'll be putting the camera in after the initial descent on the ladder, and it'll be taken 1 frame a second for most of the EVA.
<br><br>

<br><br>
02 08 26 03        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Our monitor is a little bit wavy, so it's hard for us to tell when we're - when we've got a steady picture for you.
<br><br>
02 08 26 11        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

That's affirmative.
<br><br>
02 08 26 26        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Okay. They don't in our monitor, and that leads us to make some corrections to the camera, which probably aren't required sometimes.

<br><br>
02 08 27 55        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
That was - That was me picking up some particles of paint that were floating through the air in front of the camera, there.
<br><br>
02 08 28 02        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

Okay, Buzz. We see the card up now.
<br><br>
02 08 28 26        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Okay. For those of you that don't know, this is where we log most of our data for each of the LM maneuvers, and we have another card like this that the timeline book that is laid down on the table in front of the data display keyboard; and it's on this timeline that we have all our procedures. But we obviously have to hold these in place in zero g, so we make use of the Velcro patches on the back and on the table so we can attach these down here; and then we just turn the pages over when we go to new sequences in our timeline of procedures.

We're giving you a picture now of the floor of the cabin. I think you can see the - one of the two portable life support system backpacks here in the center, and on each side, we have the two helmet visors. I'll remove one of them and show you a little closer view of what this looks like.

<br><br>
02 08 35 39        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>

The traverse from the bottom of the LM to the aft bulkhead of the command module must be about 16, 20 feet. It's not a disorienting one at all, but it's most interesting to contemplate just pushing off from one and bounding on into the other vehicle all the way through the tunnel.
<br><br>
02 08 37 44        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

<br><br>

That - That looks like what we observe from here.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Could you give us an idea of about how long it will be before you start close - closing the LM back up? Over.
<br><br>
02 08 46 00        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
We've got a little more work to do up here, Charlie. We're going to make sure that we have everything transferred around and stowed the way we want it and try to get a little bit ahead on tomorrow's timeline. I suppose that we could be out of there in another half hour or so if it was necessary.

Roger, Neil. We're not trying to push you. We're just trying to get an idea of - about water dumps and starting up the PTC again. Take your sweet time. Over.
<br><br>
02 08 46 34        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Okay. We'd like to get a flight plan update from you for the next couple of hours, here. When you think what the various constraints might be and what - what order you might like us to do things.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Mike, we'd like to go ahead and do a waste-water dump. We'd like you to dump it all the way down to zero. Over.
<br><br>
02 08 56 21        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>

<br><br>
02 08 58 09        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Roger. Just noticed that the mast that the EVA light is on is charred brown. It looks as though it took quite a beating during launch.

02 09 00 21        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. We were wondering, Neil, with your closing comment on the TV, if you were going to turn it off. It indicated that you might be considering turning it back on. We were wondering whether we want to keep the lines up. Over.
<br><br>
02 09 00 35        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Well, we want your recommendation on that, but I think we would just as soon, ourselves, terminate the TV. But if you have a commitment to keep, we'd be more than willing to turn it back on.

Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like to terminate the TV. We don't - We think we got a really - a good tape. That hour and a half show was superb. And we'd like to pick up TV - correction - PTC at about 58 hours. Over.

One slight change on the APS/DPS fuel and TEMP pressure card, and we have a change to the procedure for the secondary radiator leak check, which is to be formed at - performed at 71 hours tomorrow, and also some indications that we have a couple of landing site obliques stowed in the wrong place.

02 10 42 43        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
That's affirmative. The secondary radiator leak check is called out in the flight plan at 71 20. That procedure is listed in your launch operations book on page 2 9, L2 9. We'd like to change that procedure. Over.

<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 38/3 Page 180
<br><br>
AC 1 or AC 2. After 3 minutes, verify glycol discharge secondary pressure 39 to 51 psig. Also verify secondary EVAP out TEMP has changed. Next step, secondary coolant loop pump, OFF. Secondary glycol to radiator valve, BYPASS. That ends the procedure. Over.

If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity, secondary glycol to radiator valve to NORMAL. Secondary coolant loop pump, AC 1 or 2. After 3 minutes, verify glycol secondary discharge pressure 39 to 51 psig. Verify secondary evaporator outlet TEMP has changed. Secondary coolant loop pump, OFF.

Houston, Apollo 11. Ready to copy your update.
<br><br>
02 11 19 35        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Stand by.
<br><br>
02 11 19 50        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Okay, Buzz. The first item is that we have indications that your landing site obliques are not in the proper position. If you'll check, we think that the intermediate scale landing site oblique is stowed in the CSM lunar landmark book. We think that the large scale landing site oblique is stowed in the back of the LM lunar surface map book. Over.
<br><br>
02 11 20 38        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
I think I heard you Charlie, but I'm not sure that I understand.
<br><br>
02 11 20 45        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. According to our stowage list the - the landing site oblique should be in the transfer bag. In - But in the backup set of data, the intermediate scale oblique is in the CSM lunar landmark book, and the large scale oblique is in the back of the LM lunar surface map book; and that's the reason we think that they might be not where you think they are. Over.
<br><br>
02 11 21 15        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Okay. We've got three obliques. The last one is one I asked for recently. It's just a blow up of the second one. The first one is one that's got dotted lines on it, indicating horizon view and 50-degree LPD; and all three of those are in the transfer book. Over.
<br><br>
02 11 21 34        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Fine. We were wrong in our - in our backup set. We had those out of place. Looks like the onboard data's good. We just wanted to let you check on that one. We have an update on the APS/DPS fuel card that you place on the panel. It's a typo error. If you'll break out that little card, we've got the - correct that typo error. Over.

02 11 23 07        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger, Buzz. Under the DPS column on the pressure side, you go down to the fourth item, says pressure greater than 150 PTCA should be greater than 65 percent. Over.
<br><br>
02 11 23 28        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Okay. That's greater than 1.8 but less than 65 and greater than 150 for greater than 65.
<br><br>
02 11 23 35        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
That's affirmative. Out.
<br><br>
02 11 23 46        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
And we have three items on the mission rules NO-GO card, if you're ready to copy those. Over.
<br><br>
02 11 24 32        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Okay. I've got the mission rules NO-GO.
<br><br>
02 ll 24 34        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger, Buzz. First entry's on the EPS under AC bus A. The line extends all the way to high gate. Actually, the line should read - at DOI it would be NO-GO AC bus A. After that the NO-GO would be both buses. So if you will just pencil in both buses from PDI through high gate, it'll be correct for that line. Over.
<br><br>
02 11 25 20        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Okay. I've got that: AC bus A for DOI and both buses NO-GO for PDI on.
<br><br>
02 11 25 28        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
That's affirmative up until high gate. You can stop at the line in front of the column "5 minutes to low gate". Now the next line is under the G&C PGNS, pitch and roll GDA's. You can scratch that line completely. Over.
<br><br>
02 11 25 56        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Roger. Got it.
<br><br>
02 11 25 57        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Okay, Buzz. Last entry is down under RCS, and it's a typo error under the three - in the line "three axis attitude control". If you proceed to the right at PDI plus 05, you'll see one axis. The line goes all the way to low gate to touchdown. That's incorrect. The line should stop under "5 minutes to low gate". Over.
<br><br>
02 11 26 38        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Okay. We're stopping that at "5 minutes to low gate".
<br><br>
02 11 26 41        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
That's affirmative. That completes that card. The rest of the updates are just really for your information based on our 58 hour platform - look at the platform. We are really good shape. Your GYRO's have almost no drift in them since - plotted update we were looking at X of a minus 2.24 ...
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 38/6 Page 183
<br><br>
Y of point plus 0.87, Z of minus 0.11. Since the update, which was based on the 52 hour P52, I believe, we gave you an X drift of plus 0.79, yaw of plus 1.06, Z of plus 0.02 ... I can see the difference between the 52 hour and the 57 hour alignments were - did not really give us enough time to get a real good or completely valid update on the drift check. So we're real satisfied with the way the GYRO's are looking. The PIPA's are looking great also. We are in real good shape with those, too. Over.

<br><br>
02 11 32 28        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Okay. Loud and clear. You cut out when you were talking about the platform - something about 52 hours and after that, we never heard you again.
<br><br>
02 11 32 37        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Guess we were changing antennas. Stand by. That's affirmative, 11. We were swapping antennas on you down here. Basically the word is that we have a real good platform, very small drift on the GYRO's, and very small drift in the PIPA's. Over.
<br><br>
02 11 33 00        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Roger. Thank you. And I would like to have a few words of clarification if you will give them to me on the RCS ... what that change of pitch may mean.
<br><br>
02 11 33 14        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Copy. A few words of clarification on the RCS? Oh. Roger. The update there, Neil, you are speaking of about the one axis down to 5 minutes of low gate?
<br><br>
02 11 33 31        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Yes. That's right. I'm not quite sure what that ... means beyond 5 minutes.
<br><br>
02 11 33 38        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Stand by. I'll make sure I got my story straight with Control. Stand by.

Okay.
<br><br>
02 11 34 33        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. On the RCS, what we are saying is that if we lose control about one axis prior to low gate, we would recommend an abort. This would require a - a loss of - of two distinct jets which is not very probable, but that is what we are recommending. After low gate we would continue on. We would recommend that we continue on to attempt a landing. Over.

<br><br>
02 12 50 57        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
That's negative, Mike. If you'll look at the plot, which we'll save for you and let you see it postflight, it started off immediately on the first REV and just spiraled out to about - oh 20 to - 20 degrees in pitch, and then it seemed to be setting up a spiral around an offset pitch point of about 20 degrees off from 90 degrees; but we didn't want to take a chance that it would become stable at that point. We thought it might diverge, and so we called you and started over again. Over.

Yes indeed. O2 fuel cell purge at 71 hours, and when you feel like copying, I've got a flight plan update containing - I guess that and some other items for you.

<br><br>
02 23 07 05        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger, 11. This is Houston. At approximately 71 hours to 72 hours, we have you down for an eat period which I imagine is probably in progress already. 71 hours: O2 fuel cell purge; 72 hours GET: CO2 filter change number 6, secondary radiator flow check. And we'll send you up a P37 block data on a 2 hour pass, pericynthion pass, return mode abort. At 73 hours 00 minutes: stop PTC at approximately 0 degrees roll. That is, when you're ccming up on 0 degrees roll angle around 73 hours, we'd like you to stop PTC. And perform a P52 option 3 remaining in the PTC REFSMMAT for a drift check. 73 hours, 20 minutes: we'll give you a P27 update to the landing site REFSMMAT, LOI 1 state vector, and target load. 73 hours 30 minutes: maneuver to 000 roll, pitch, and yaw; high gain antenna angles will be pitch 0, yaw 335; and perform a P52 option 1 using the new landing site REFSMMAT. Resume the nominal flight plan at 74 hours GET. Over.
<br><br>
02 23 09 08        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Okay. We'll get started on the fuel cell purge while we're eating. CO2 canister change number 6; secondary radiator flow check; copy some pads. Also at 72 hours, stop PTC 0 roll at 73; do a P52 option 3; we'll get your uplink REFSMMAT for the landing site; and at 000 - let's see, now was this with the old REFSMMAT or the new REFSMMAT?

Okay. We're ready to listen.
<br><br>
02 23 24 18        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Okay, 11. It turns out that the engine performance during both of your burns so far this mission has been the same as it was on engine acceptance tests. The onboard PC reading is due to a known gage calibration factor between what you've actually got in the chamber and what you're reading out on the gage. We expect single bank operation to be 90 - that is, 90 psi on the gage with an actual chamber pressure of 95 psi. In dual bank operation, the chamber pressure is 94 psi on the gage with an actual of 99 psi. 80 psi on the gage on board correlates to 83 psi actual. And we recommend that you stick to an LOI termination cue of 80 psi on the gage. That is, no change to the mission rules. Over.

02 23 33 49        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

<br><br>
02 23 34 00        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Roger. What sort of settings could you recommend for the solar corona? We've got the Sun right behind the edge of the Moon now.
<br><br>
02 23 34 12        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger.
<br><br>
02 23 34 16        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
It's quite an erie sight. There is a very marked three dimensional aspect of having the Sun's corona coming from behind the Moon the way it is.
<br><br>
02 23 34 27        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger.
<br><br>
02 23 34 31        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
And it looks as though - I guess what's giving it that three dimensional effect is the earthshine. I can see Tycho fairly clearly - at least if I'm right side up, I believe it's Tycho, in moonshine - I mean, in earthshine. And, of course, I can see the sky is lit all the way around the Moon, even on the limb of it where there's no earthshine or sunshine.

If you'd like to take some pictures, we recommend using magazine Uniform which is loaded with high speed black and white film, interior lights off, electric Hasselblad with the 80 millimeter lens. And you're going to have to hand hold us, I guess. We're recommending an f stop of 2.8, and we'd like to get a sequence of time exposures. Over.

Houston, it's been a real change for us. Now we are able to see stars again and recognize constellations for the first time on the trip. It's - the sky is full of stars. Just like the nightside of Earth. But all the way here, we have only been able to see stars occasionally and perhaps through the monocular, but not recognize any star patterns.

All right. On the secondary loop check when we went to FLOW on the secondary radiators, the quantity dropped from 40 percent down to 36 in the first 10 seconds and then stabilized at 36 for the remainder of the 30 seconds.

Apollo 11, this is Houston. We believe that is normal system operation. The radiators are expected to be very cold right now and apparently the decrease you saw was due to contraction in the fluid. Over.

You might be interested in knowing, since you are already on the way, that a Houston astrologer, Ruby Graham, says that all the signs are right for your trip to the Moon. She says that Neil is clever, Mike has good judgment, and Buzz can work out intricate problems. She also says Neil tends to see the world through rose colored glasses, but he is always ready to help the afflicted or distressed. Neil, you are also suppose to have "intuition that enables you to interpret life with feeling." Buzz is to be very sociable and cannot bear to be alone in addition to having excellent critical ability. Since she didn't know at what hour Mike was born, she has decided that he either has the same attributes as Neil or he is inventive with an unconventional attitude that might seem eccentric to the unimaginative.

The view of the Moon that we've been having recently is really spectacular. It fills about three quarters of the hatch window, and of course, we can see the entire circumference, even though part of it is in complete shadow and part of it's in earthshine. It's a view worth the price of the trip.

03 01 20 47        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. If you don't get in the way of the Czar while he's brushing his teeth, we'd like you to bring up the primary accumulator quantity a little bit. We're showing the quantity now at 20.6 percent on TM. Seems to have gone down a bit since you've gone into the shadow. We'd like it serviced to bring the quantity up to between 30 and 40 percent, preferable 35 percent. Over.

Apollo 11 is getting its first view of the landing approach. This time we are going over the Taruntius crater, and the pictures and maps brought back by Apollo 8 and 10 have given us a very good preview of what to look at here. It looks very much like the pictures, but like the difference between watching a real football game and watching it on TV. There's no substitute for actually being here.

We're going over the Messier series of craters right at the time, looking vertically down on them, and Messier A we can see good sized blocks in the bottom of the crater. I don't know what our altitude is now, but in any case, those are pretty good size blocks.

11, Houston. During your SPS burn as played back on tape down here, we've observed the nitrogen tank Bravo pressure in the SPS system dropping a little bit more than we anticipated. It's holding steady right now. We'll continue to watch it and keep you posted if anything comes up. Over.

And Boothill, Duke Island, Sidewinder, looking at Maskelyne W, that's the yaw round checkpoint, and just coming into the terminator. At the terminator it's ashen and gray. As you get further away from the terminator, it gets to be
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 49/5 Page 220
<br><br>
a lighter gray, and as you get closer to the subsolar point, you can definitely see browns and tans on the ground, according to the last Apollo 11 observation anyway.

- - Okay. Aristarchus is at angle Echo 9 on your ATO chart. It's about 394 miles north of track. However, at your present altitude, which is about 167 nautical miles, it ought to be over - that is within view of your horizon: 23 degrees north, 47 west. Take a look and see if you see anything worth noting up there. Over.
<br><br>
03 04 58 34        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>

Hey, Houston. I'm looking north up toward Aristarchus now, and I can't really tell at that distance whether I am really looking at Aristarchus, but there's an area that is considerably more illuminated than the surrounding area. It just has - seems to have a slight amount of fluorescence to it. A crater can be seen, and the area around the crater is quite bright.

<br><br>
03 05 14 23        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Houston, Apollo 11. Looking up at the same area now and it does seem to be reflecting some of the earthshine. I'm not sure whether it was worked
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 50/3 Page 224
<br><br>
out to be about zero phase to - Well, at least there is one wall of the crater that seems to be more illuminated than the others, and that one - if we are lining up with the Earth correctly, does seem to put it about at zero phase. That area is definitely lighter than anything else that I could see out this window. I am not sure that I am really identifying any phosphorescence, but that definitely is lighter than anything else in the neighborhood.
<br><br>
03 05 15 15        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, this is Houston. Can you discern any difference in color of the illumination, and is that an inner or an outer wall from the crater? Over.
<br><br>
03 05 15 34        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Roger. That's an inner wall of the crater.
<br><br>
03 05 15 43        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
No, there doesn't appear to be any color involved in it, Bruce.
<br><br>
03 05 15 47        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. You said inner wall. Would that be the inner edge of the northern surface?
<br><br>
03 05 16 00        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
I guess it would be the inner edge of the westnorthwest part, the part that would be more nearly normal if you were looking at it from the Earth.
<br><br>
03 05 16 20        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

<br><br>
03 05 32 42        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>

Houston, Apollo 11. One of the larger craters on the back side - I noticed a small, dark speck on the outer wall and I put the monocular on it. I was able to see - oh, an area maybe a quarter of a mile in diameter. It was really a freshlooking dark colored pit, and that seems to be in contrast with all the other fresh little craters or holes that you can perceive on the walls of any of these craters. Around this particular one there seems to be two or three of these - especially the one that caught my attention. Quite remarkable. Over.
<br><br>
03 06 26 24        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Do you have a location on that one?
<br><br>
03 06 26 34        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
No, not a precise one. I've got several pictures of it, though.

We're getting a beautiful picture in down there now, 11. The color's coming in quite clearly, and we can see the horizon and the relative blackness of space, and without getting into the question of grays and browns, it looks, at least on our monitor, sort of a brownish gray.
<br><br>
03 06 27 10        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
That's a good, reasonable way of describing it. It appears to me as though it made a difference just sitting back in the tunnel and gazing at all windows; it makes a difference which one you're looking out of. For example, the camera
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 50/7 Page 228
<br><br>
right now is looking out the number 5 window, and it definitely gives a rosier or tanner tinge, especially when you look straight through it and not at an angle. Over.

Houston, Apollo 11. Could you observe a difference in the N2 pressures before LOI? It seems to me as though the two were not equal on the ... B tank was a little low on pressure. Over.
<br><br>
03 06 28 57        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
I'm flying it in SPS minimum impulse, Houston, and it's rather difficult to keep it on a constant data. The LM wants to wander up and down. I'm not sure if it's in response to MASCONN's or what, but I can get it completely stabilized in DATA and let it alone, and in another couple of minutes it will have developed its own rate.

Okay. There's - on the right side of the screen at the present time, there's a triple crater with - with a small crater between the first and second; and the one at the bottom of the screen is Schubert Y.

Now the crater that's in the center of the screen now is Webb. We'd be looking straight down on it at about 6 minutes before power descent. It has a relatively flat bottom to the crater, and you can see maybe two or three craters that are in the bottom of it on the western wall, the wall that's now nearest the - the camera. Near the bottom of the screen, we can see a dimple crater, just on the outside. And then coming back toward the bottom of the screen and to the left, you can see a series of depressions. It's this type of connected craters that give us most interest to discover why they're in the particular pattern that they're in. I'll zoom the camera in now and try and give you a closer look at it.
<br><br>
03 06 42 48        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. We're observing the dimple crater now. The central peak we can see on the Orbiter photos doesn't seem to stand out very well here.
<br><br>
03 06 43 02        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>

And you'll notice on the pitch thruster activity, I've still - I've put in a dozen mininum impulses in pitchdown, and I'm still far from correcting back to 315.
<br><br>
03 06 43 20        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>

<br><br>
03 06 43 29        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

<br><br>
03 06 44 12        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>

<br><br>
03 06 44 59        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Well, I can't get behind to see the monitor. I'll bring the focus in, but we're going to be looking down past one of the LM quads and one of the antennas almost straight down at the ground track that we'll be seeing coming in now. I guess there's maybe 2 or 3 minutes before power descent.
<br><br>
03 06 45 37        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
All right, that should put the LM structure about in focus, and I'm going to move it out to infinity and then expand the field of view.

Hello, Apollo 11. This is Houston. We show you coming up on the terminator at 78 53, about 7 minutes from now, and we've also got the LOI 2 and TEI 5 PAD's ready for you after the TV whenever you want to terminate. Over.
<br><br>
03 06 46 31        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Roger.
<br><br>
03 06 46 33        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
And we're getting a good view of the track leading into the landing site now and -
<br><br>
03 06 46 58        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Okay, And it looks like we got Secchi K, went by about 10 seconds ago; coming up on Apollo Ridge.
<br><br>
03 06 47 36        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
And in the right hand portion of our screen right now, we can see Messier Alfa and Bravo with the light colored rays streaming off in one direction.
<br><br>
03 06 48 00        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
I don't know if you can make out, but in the Sea of Fertility there are a number of craters that are just barely discernible, old, old craters whose outlines are just barely able to be seen.
<br><br>

<br><br>
03 06 48 14        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. I think we can make them out. The color really enhances our ability to discern features and craters over what we see in real time on our black and white monitor.
<br><br>
03 06 48 31        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Right. The - At these low Sun angles, there's no trace of brown, it's now returned to a very gray appearance and, like the 8 crew says, it has a look of plaster of paris to it at this Sun angle, which is completely lacking in ...
<br><br>
03 06 48 49        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger.
<br><br>
03 06 49 06        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Okay. This is very close to ignition point for power descent. Just passing Mount Marilyn that - that triangular shaped mountain that you see in the center of the screen at the present time with crater Secchi Theta on top of the far northern edge of the mountain.
<br><br>
03 06 49 32        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. We're getting a good view of Mount Marilyn and the Secchi Theta.
<br><br>
03 06 49 45        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
And now we're looking at what we call Boot Hill; occurs 20 seconds into the descent.
<br><br>
03 06 50 08        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
The bright, sharp rimmed crater at the very right edge of the screen, Censorinus T. Now passing the - the 1 minute point in power descent.
<br><br>
03 06 50 30        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. And for your information, your current altitude is 148 nautical miles above the surface.
<br><br>
03 06 50 39        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Don't you think?
<br><br>
03 06 50 43        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
I'm unable to determine altitude at all looking out the window. I couldn't tell whether we were down at 60 or up at 170.
<br><br>
03 06 50 50        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
I bet you could tell if you were down at 50,000 feet.
<br><br>
03 06 50 57        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
I wouldn't be surprised.
<br><br>
03 06 51 11        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
We're passing some steep ridges here. The edge of some old craters that were photographed by Apollo 10; and those - the crew of Apollo 10 was very impressed with the steepness of these ridges when they came over them at about 50,000 feet.
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 51/7 Page 236
<br><br>
03 06 51 36        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. We can observe they're also steep even from this altitude. You got quite a shadow being cast by the Sun at these low angles.
<br><br>
03 06 51 47        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
The entire surface is getting considerably darker than the surface that we looked at previously when the Sun was quite high above us. The crater in the - bright crater in the center of the screen, - well, the smaller one is Censorinus.
<br><br>
03 06 52 09        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. And we show you low over 1 minute from the terminator at the present time.
<br><br>
03 06 52 24        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
How's the brightness of the picture you're receiving? You think we ought to open f stop some as we approach the terminator?
<br><br>
03 06 52 34        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Yes. The brightness is still doing quite well. You can go ahead and open it up a stop or two. The automatic light level compensation seems to be working beautifully.
<br><br>
03 06 52 58        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
There's a good picture of Boot Hill.
<br><br>
03 06 53 02        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. We're - -
<br><br>
03 06 53 03        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Three minutes and 15 seconds into the descent.
<br><br>
03 06 53 08        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. We're seeing Boot Hill now.
<br><br>
03 06 53 10        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
The next crater coming into the bottom, that's Duke Island right there, and to the left, the crater - the largest of the craters near the center of the picture right now is Maskelyne W. This is a position check during descent at about 3 minutes and 39 seconds, and it's our down range position check and cross range position check prior to yawing over face up to acquire the landing radar. Past this point, we would be unable to see the surface below us until getting very near the landing area.
<br><br>
03 06 53 57        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. I imagine you'll get a - you'll get a real good look at that tomorrow afternoon.
<br><br>
03 06 54 14        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Sinuous Rille is the one that was referred to in Apollo 10 as Sidewinder.
<br><br>
03 06 54 21        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
That's a good name, too: Sidewinder and Diamondback. It looks like a couple of snakes down there in a lake bed.

Roger.
<br><br>
03 06 54 49        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Contrast has increased and only the sunlit side of these ridges remain illuminated, while the dark sides and the shadow will become completely black.
<br><br>
03 06 54 59        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, this is Houston. The picture's getting a little grainy now. You might go ahead and open up the f stop.
<br><br>
03 06 55 19        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Landing point is just barely in the darkness. That one crater, the upper part of which you see, lower part completely in darkness. The small, well defined crater is Moltke, which is about abeam of the landing sight.
<br><br>
03 06 55 32        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. We can just see; it looks like a little less than half of its rim right now.
<br><br>
03 06 55 45        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
And we can make out just barely some features on the surface, maybe from earthshine.
<br><br>
03 06 55 58        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Are you wide open on the f stop at this time?
<br><br>
03 06 56 03        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Yes, we are.
<br><br>
03 06 56 06        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Yes. And it looks like we're just about to get the Sun coming into the lens, so we'll have to move the camera away.
<br><br>
03 06 56 12        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger.
<br><br>
03 06 56 14        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
We can't see any earthshine or any surface features at all in earthshine now due to the fact that the LM is very bright and is causing our pupils to contract. It's a very fantastic view to see the terminator as you look along the edge of it. I think you'll agree that some of these craters that you're seeing in the picture now are really accentuated by the lengthening of the shadows as they come close to the terminator.
<br><br>
03 06 56 42        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Yes. It's a very beautiful and a rugged sight that we've got on the screen now.
<br><br>
03 06 56 52        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
And I think you've got some interesting data on thruster firing versus pitch angle. It looks
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 51/9 Page 238
<br><br>
like that LM just wants to head down towards the surface, is all.
<br><br>
03 06 57 01        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. I have a comment here that says that's what the LM was built for.
<br><br>
03 06 57 12        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
I believe!
<br><br>
03 06 57 45        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
And as the Moon sinks slowly in the west, Apollo 11 bids good day to you.
<br><br>
03 06 57 50        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. We sort of thought it was the Sun setting in the east.
<br><br>
03 06 58 00        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Well, it depends on your point of view.

Remarks: On your DAP load, we would like an R1 20101 vice the value which appears in the flight plan. In making the sextant star check this must be done between GET of 79 30 10, at which time the star comes above the horizon, and 79 52 10, which is your local sunrise due to the fact that this star's relatively close to the Sun. Your burn orientation is heads down, retrograde pitched up 28 degress with respect to local horizontal. The calculated values for NOUN 42 are HA 65.6 and HP 54.6. Both of those being plus. Read back.

Houston. On your comment about the mare lapping up to the terrain - mountainous terrain, is that an impression like a lava flow coming in around a prominence, Neil, or is it more -looks like it's sloping up at that point? Over.
<br><br>
03 08 57 06        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
It isn't true everywhere, but there's certainly places where there seems to be a slope downward towards the shoreline on the mare. In other words, from the mare down to the shoreline is a downward slope indicating that it might be a lava flow.

All that procedure for P22 seemed to work very well. The only thing that was a little odd, is that there was some DAP thruster activity. I had pitch in ACCEL COMMAND, and roll and yaw in RATE COMMAND, and somehow, roll and yaw got excited and the DAP went into a flurry of thruster firing. We've noticed the same thing in the CMS, and just written it off as a CMS peculiarity.

Go ahead. Over.

03 12 31 40        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Okay, 11. First of all, on our LM systems checks, everything went fine. I would like to remind you, though, tomorrow you may see an ascent pressure light when you activate the MC&W. There should be no problem, however. You did note that the APS AUX tank pressure was only reading 111 psi, which is normal at this point, but below the level which will trigger your light due to the helium which has been dissolved into the propellant. Over.
<br><br>
03 12 32 18        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Roger. Understand that. Thank you.
<br><br>
03 12 32 20        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. And next item, the supercritical helium rise rate is nominal, and you also had that question for us about your thruster activity during the P22 on the last REV. Believe we understand that now, as you reported that your pitch was in ACCEL COMMAND and your yaw and roll were in RATE COMMAND. You were firing your pitch thrusters. This will couple rates into your yaw and roll axes, and the - You were at that time holding only half a degree deadband and coupling rates into yaw and roll produced the extra firings about the yaw and roll axes. Over.
<br><br>
03 12 33 07        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Yes. That may be true. It's very peculiar coupling, in that it waits longer than you would think and its reaction is greater than you would think. We were getting yaw rates of around four tenths of a degree per second, for example.
<br><br>
03 12 33 23        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger, Mike. We did play the data back, and that's the way it looked upon analysis of the chart recordings back here. Over.

The marks all apparently were very good, and we've got a full page of data here relative to the altitudes of the various site locations, which I won't read up to you, but I did want to let you know that the marks apparently went very well.

Apollo 11, Houston. We're still unable to pick you up on the high gain antenna. Request you go to MANUAL, and wide beamwidth. The pitch and yaw angles in your checklist are good ones. You should be able to find us there. Over.

03 12 53 33        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. That's all we want. We want to stay in narrow, and we're a little puzzled about why we lost you here a few minutes ago. Do you have any ideas?
<br><br>
03 12 53 48        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
No, we sure don't (cough) - sure don't. We're showing - we're showing about 15 degrees plus pitch and about 270. That ought to be good and clear.
<br><br>
03 12 54 00        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
We concur there. We still don't have any good ideas on why we were lost then.

03 13 09 31        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. We're going to try to check out this ability to automatically reacquire on the S band, and what we want to do is to secure our uplink carrier for about 30 seconds. Then we will turn it back on and see if the spacecraft equipment will automatically reacquire. So if you do not get a call from us within about 3 minutes, that means we have not been able to reacquire and request your assistance on a manual acquisition. Over.
<br><br>
03 13 10 04        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Okay. We understand.
<br><br>
03 13 10 11        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. We also would appreciate - if you will note the angles that the antenna tracks through in its attempt to reacquire. Over.

Roger. We'll do that.

03 13 13 28        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. It looks like we're locked back up again with no delay. How does it look on board? Over.
<br><br>
03 13 13 37        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Roger. The signal strength dropped very rapidly to zero; and the pitch and yaw, in about 3 secconds, moved toward 40 degrees pitch and 240 degrees yaw. Right now, they're sitting on about 15 degrees pitch and about 265 degrees yaw. So they didn't move very far, about 30 degrees apiece; and then they picked right back on up again. Over.
<br><br>
03 13 14 19        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Some of "The Luckiest People" in the background there. We copied your pitch and yaw angles.
<br><br>

11, Houston. Could you give us the location of your - pitch and yaw location of your position indicators? Over.
<br><br>

<br><br>
03 13 15 39        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Roger. They're in the same position as the antenna right now; plus 15 degrees pitch and - no, now wait a minute. I got them - got it at about 275 instead of 265.
<br><br>
03 13 15 57        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Okay. Thank you.
<br><br>
03 13 16 23        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. We'd like to try the same procedure once more. We'll leave the carrier a little longer and be back up for a call within 4 minutes. Over.
<br><br>
03 13 16 35        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Okay.
<br><br>
03 13 20 07        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. We're locked back up again. Can you give us a report on how the antenna behaved?
<br><br>
03 13 20 24        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Roger. It was essentially identical as before. The pitch went to 45, 40 to 45 and the yaw went to about - to about 255, 245 to 255; and then it rather quickly locked up at 15 degrees pitch and 270 yaw. Over.
<br><br>
03 13 20 49        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. Roger. Your angles are 45 and 255. Do I understand that as soon as the carrier dropped, it went to these angles; or did it only go to these angles after the uplink carrier was reenabled and the antenna began to reacquire? Over.
<br><br>
03 13 21 12        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
No. As soon as the carrier dropped off, why, it drifted over into those angles and stayed there. Then when it came back up again, why, it hunted around for a while, but it didn't get any further off. Gradually brought it on in to the angles where it is right now; and then the signal strength would take several jumps as evidently it goes from wide to medium to narrow. Over.
<br><br>
03 13 21 38        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. Understand. And on another subject, request you zero your optics for the night. Over.

Roger, 11. And we've got about 14 minutes until LOS. A0S is 86 30, an hour away. We're wondering whether or not you plan to have one man up at that time or would you all like to be asleep inside the next hour? Over.
<br><br>
03 13 28 25        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Somebody will be up.
<br><br>
03 13 28 27        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. The thing that we're still puzzling on is the antenna, and if - as long as there will be somebody up, why, we would like to have somebody check the automatic REACQ on the next AOS.
<br><br>
03 13 28 42        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Okay. We'll do that. We haven't chlorinated the water yet, and we haven't changed the lithium hydroxide. We're just still finishing up dinner.

President Nixon's worship service at the White House is also dedicated to the mission, and our fellow astronaut, Frank Borman, is still in there pitching and will read the passage from Genesis which was read on Apollo 8 last Christmas. The Cabinet and members of Congress, with emphasis on the Senate and House space committees, have been invited, along with a number of other guests. Buzz, your son, Andy, got a tour of MSC yesterday.

Roger. Among the large headlines concerning Apollo this morning, there's one asking that you watch for a lovely girl with a big rabbit. An ancient legend says a beautiful Chinese girl called Chang-o has been living there for 4000 years. It seems she was banished to the Moon because she stole the pill of immortality from her husband. You might also look for her companion, a large Chinese rabbit, who is easy to spot since he is always standing on his hind feet in the shade of a cinnamon tree. The name of the rabbit is not reported.

National League Allstars will be playing ball in Washington. Mel Stottlemyre of the Yankees is expected to be the American League's first pitcher. No one is predicting who will be first pitcher for the National League yet. They have nine on the roster. Even though research has certainly paid off in the space program, research doesn't always pay off, it seems. The Woodstream Corporation, parent company of the Animal Trap Company of America which has made more than a billion wooden spring mousetraps, reports that it built a better mousetrap but the world didn't beat a door to its path - didn't beat a path to its door. As a matter of fact, the company had to go back to the oldfashioned kind. They said, "We should have spent more time researching housewives and less time researching mice". And the "Black Beag - Bugle" is all completed for the morning.

Roger. In the first of - on page 47, step 1, we had the guidance control in PGNS and mode control PGNS AUTO and, of course, the circuit breakers are not in on the thrusters yet. So when we started through the DAP and proceeded on NOUN 46 - and we're looking at NOUN 47 now,
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 63/6 Page 286
<br><br>
so we've got an RCS TTA light and we've got four out of the eight other bright colored red flags. I think that this is explained by the fact that we are in PGNS and AUTO and unable to fire the thrusters.

Hey, Houston, that may have seemed like a very long final phase.

We'll get to the details of what's around here, but it looks like a collection of just about every variety of shape, angularity, granularity, about every variety of rock you could find. The colors - Well, it varies pretty much depending on how you're looking relative to the zerophase point. There doesn't appear to be too much of a general color at all. However, it looks as though some of the rocks and boulders, of which there are quite a few in the near area, it looks as though they're going to have some interesting colors to them. Over.

Houston, the guys that said that we wouldn't be able to tell precisely where we are are the winners today. We were a little busy worrying about program alarms and things like that in the part of the descent where we would normally be picking out our landing spot; and aside from a good look at several of the craters we came over in the final descent, I haven't been able to pick out the things on the horizon as a reference as yet.

The area out the left hand window is a relatively level plain cratered with a fairly large number of craters of the 5  to 50 foot variety, and some ridges - small, 20, 30 feet high, I would guess, and literally thousands of little 1  and 2 foot craters around the area. We see some angular blocks out several hundred feet in front of us that are probably 2 feet in size and have angular edges. There is a hill in view, just about on the ground track ahead of us. Difficult to estimate, but might be a half a mile or a mile.

Columbia, Houston. First of all, we'd like a waste water dump to 10 percent on the backside. Secondly, it does not look like we are going to need any plane change at this time, so we will not be uplinking a new REFSMMAT. Third item, I would like all of your CRYO heaters to AUTO, and we are ready for a battery charge, battery BRAVO; it will last about 7 hours. If you should go to sleep, we will be terminating that BATT charge, but at the moment, we can go ahead and start the BATT charge on BATT Bravo. And a final item, for your SM RCS configuration for your rest period, register 1 for the DAP is 11111; DAP register 2, 01100. And your AUTO RCS select

Columbia, this is Houston. The best we can do on topo features is to advise you to look to the west of the irregularly shaped crater, and then work on down to the southwest of it. Over.

04 10 38 42        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font> (COLUMBIA)<br>
Roger, Houston. Columbia ... I kept my eyes glued to the sextant that time hoping I'd get a flash of reflected light off the LM, but I wasn't able to see any of my scan areas that you suggested.
<br><br>
04 10 38 56        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. On that southern of the old craters, there's a small bright crater on the southern rim. One plot would put him slightly to the west of that small bright crater, about 500 to 1000 feet. Do you see anything down there? Over.
<br><br>
04 10 39 19        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font> (COLUMBIA)<br>

<br><br>
04 10 44 17        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
More to the north and a little more to the east. The feature that I was describing to you, the small bright crater on the rim of the large, fairly old crater, would be about Mike 0.8 and 8.2. Over.

Okay.

I'm at the foot of the ladder. The LM footpads are only depressed in the surface about 1 or 2 inches, although the surface appears to be very, very fine grained, as you get close to it. It's almost like a powder. Down there, it's very fine.
<br><br>

<br><br>
04 13 24 48        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font> (TRANQ)<br>
And the - the surface is fine and powdery. I can - I can pick it up loosely with my toe. It does adhere in fine layers like powdered charcoal to the sole and sides of my boots. I only go in a small fraction of an inch, maybe an eighth of an inch, but I can see the footprints of my boots and the treads in the fine, sandy particles.

There seems to be no difficulty in moving around as we suspected. It's even perhaps easier than the simulations at one sixth g that we performed in the various simulations on the ground. It's actually no trouble to walk around. Okay. The descent engine did not leave a crater of any size. It has about 1 foot clearance on the ground. We're essentially on a very level place here. I can see some evidence of rays emanating from the descent engine, but a very insignificant amount.

This is very interesting. It's a very soft surface, but here and there where I plug with the contingency sample collector, I run into a very hard surface, but it appears to be very cohesive material of the same sort. I'll try to get a rock in here. Just a couple.
<br><br>

It has a stark beauty all its own. It's like much of the high desert of the United States. It's different but it's very pretty out here. Be advised that a lot of the rock samples out here, the hard rock samples, have what appear to be vesicles in the surface. Also, I am looking at one now that appears to have some sort of phenocryst.

For those who haven't read the plaque, we'll read the plaque that's on the front landing gear of this LM. First there's two hemispheres, one showing each of the two hemispheres of the Earth.

Okay. You do have to be rather careful to keep track of where your center of mass is. Sometimes, it takes about two or three paces to make sure you've got your feet underneath you.
<br><br>

Neil and Buzz, this is Houston. To clarify my last, your consumables are in good shape at this time. The 30 minute reference was with respect to the nominal timeline. Over.

Roger. I understand that.
<br><br>
04 14 46 36        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font> (EVA)<br>
I don't note any abnormalities in the LM. The pods seem to be in good shape. The primary and secondary struts are in good shape. Atennas are all in place. There's no evidence of problem underneath the LM due to engine exhaust or drainage of any kind.
<br><br>

04 14 47 18        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font> (EVA)<br>
It's very surprising, the very surprising lack of penetration of all four of the foot pads. I'd say if we were to try and determine just how far below the surface they would have penetrated, you'd measure maybe 3 inches, wouldn't you say, Neil?

At the most, yes. That Y strut there is probably even less than that.

I get a picture of the plus Y strut taken from near the descent stage, and I think we'll be able to see a little bit better what the thermal effects are. Seem to be quite minimal.
<br><br>
04 14 48 48        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font> (EVA)<br>
There's one picture taken in the right rear of the spacecraft looking at the skirt of the descent stage, shows a quite darkening of the surface color, a rather minimal amount of radiating or etching away or erosion of the surface. 0n descent, both of us remarked that we could see a large amount of very fine dust particles moving out. It was reported beforehand that we would probably see an upgassing from the surface after actual engine shutdown, but as I recall, I was unable to confirm that.

04 14 50 26        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font> (EVA)<br>

These boulders look like basalt, and they have probably 2 percent white minerals in them, the white crystals.

I think that small craters - they look like little impact craters where shot - B B shot has hit the surface.

You can go BLOCK; however, we'd like you to hold off on the P52 option 1 align until after you've passed landing site 2; and we're requesting that you perform another P22 and attempt to find the LM this pass. I've got some numbers for you when you're ready to copy. Over.

04 16 21 14        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger, Tranquility. We'd like to hold off as long as possible on the lithium hydroxide canister. Make that one of the last things you do in getting ready for the DEPRESS, if you can. Over.
<br><br>
04 16 21 31        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font> (TRANQ)<br>
Roger. We're planning on doing that. I was just wondering how much longer we want to wait, though. We've probably got another half an hour's worth of picture taking, and I guess we could run through an eat cycle and then change the canister, and then DEPRESS. Over.

<br><br>
04 16 35 18        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

Tranquility, Houston. First question here is how your best estimate of the yaw on the - of the LM as compared to the nominal preflight plan. Over.
<br><br>
04 18 34 16        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font> (TRANQ)<br>
We got 13 degrees left on the ball, and I think that's probably about right. Looking at the shadow and so on, we prob - probably about 13 degrees left of the shadow.
<br><br>
04 18 34 31        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. That's 13 degrees left of the shadow. And, next question relates to the depth of the bulk sampling that you obtained near the first part of the EVA and any changes in composition that you might have observed during the bulk sampling interval. Over.
<br><br>
04 18 35 02        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font> (TRANQ)<br>
I'm not sure I understand that question, but we got a good bit of the ground mass in the bulk sample plus a sizable number of selected rock fragments of different types.
<br><br>
04 18 35 22        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger, Neil. One of the implications here is the depth from which the bulk sample was collected. Did you manage to get down there several inches or nearer the surface? Over.
<br><br>
04 18 35 37        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font> (TRANQ)<br>
We got some down from as much as 3 inches in the area where I was looking at variation with depth in the bulk sample. There really wasn't appreciable difference, and I didn't run into any hard bed. Later on, or at some other times and other areas, why, I'd get down just a short distance, an inch or two, and couldn't go any further.
<br><br>
04 18 36 06        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Believe we understand down as deep as 3 inches, did not hit any hard bed, and no significant changes in composition to that depth. Next question, the - the second SRC was packed rather hurriedly due to the time limitation, and wonder if you would be able to provide any more detailed description of the samples which were included in the second SRC. Over.
<br><br>
04 18 36 40        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font> (TRANQ)<br>
We got two core tubes and solar wind and about half of the big sample bag full of assorted rocks which I picked up hurriedly from around the area. I tried to get as many representative types as I could.

04 18 37 09        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger, Neil. Next topic here relates to the rays which emanate from the DPS engine burning area. We're wondering if the rays emanating from the - beneath the engine are any darker or lighter than the surrounding surface. Over.
<br><br>
04 18 37 42        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font> (TRANQ)<br>
The ones that I saw back in the aft end of the spacecraft appeared to be a good bit darker; of course, viewed from the aft end, why, they did have the Sun shining directly on them. It seemed as though the material had been baked somewhat and also scattered in a radially outward direction, but in that particular area, this feature didn't extend more than about 2, maybe 3 feet, from the skirt of the engine. Over.
<br><br>
04 18 38 24        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Understand that near the aft end out to the east that the rays did appear darker. I understand, Buzz, that these were - this was the appearance of the material which had been uncovered by the rays that appeared darker for 2 or 3 feet extending outward. Is that correct?
<br><br>
04 18 38 49        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font> (TRANQ)<br>
No. I wouldn't say it was necessarily material that had been uncovered. I think some of the material might have been baked or in some way caused to be more cohesive and perhaps flow together in some way, I don't know. Now, in other areas, before we started trampling around out front, why, we could see that small erosion had taken place in a radially outward direction, but it had left no significant mark on the surface other than just having eroded it away. Now, it was different back in the - right under the skirt itself. It seems as though the surface had been baked in a streak fashion, and I think a couple of pictures on film will show this. But that didn't extend out very far. Over.
<br><br>
04 18 39 48        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger, Tranquility. And this baked appearance that you described, at least the suggestion is that it was due to the heat of the engine at any rate. Next subject, did - -
<br><br>
04 18 40 01        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font> (TRANQ)<br>
I believe so.
<br><br>
04 18 40 02        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Next subject, did either of the solar panels on the PSE touch the surface of the Moon during deployment? Over.

<br><br>
04 18 40 19        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font> (TRANQ)<br>
I think that two corners did touch, since when it was deployed, both of them didn't come out at the same time. It unfolded a little unevenly, and of course, the terrain that it was on was a little bit - not quite as level as it was - as I would like to have it. And I think that two corners did touch to about 1 inch - no, three quarters to a half an inch deep; and maybe along the bottom, it might have been maybe 3 inches, leaving a small triangular coating on two of the corners; and I think these are on the western ones. Over.

Roger. Understand the description there. And the next subject, on the two core tubes which you collected, how did the driving force required to collect these tubes compare? Was there any difference? Over
<br><br>
04 18 41 27        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font> (TRANQ)<br>
Not significantly. I could get down to about the first 2 inches without much of a problem, and then as I would pound it in about as hard as I could do it, and the second one took two hands on the hammer, and I was putting pretty good dents in the top of the extension rod, and it just wouldn't go much more than - I think the total depth might have been about 8 or 9 inches. But even there, it didn't - For some reason it didn't seem to want to stand up straight. In other words, I'd keep driving it in and it would dig some sort of a hole but it wouldn't - just penetrate in a way that would support it and keep it from falling over, if that makes any sense at all. It didn't really to me. Over.
<br><br>
04 18 42 22        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger, Buzz. I think I've got the picture. You indicate that little difference between the two samples and that in each case you got down about 2 inches without any problems and then had to continue hammering rather vigorously in order to continue driving it in to a total depth of 8 or 9 inches, and even at that point the rods did not want to stay vertical, that they'd tend to fall over on you even after pounding in that far. Is that correct?
<br><br>
04 18 42 59        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font> (TRANQ)<br>
Yes. That's about it. It wasn't a rapid change in resistive force. And also I noticed when I took the bit off that the material was quite well packed, a good bit darker, and it - The way it adhered to the core tube gave me the distinct impression of being moist. Over.
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 74/7 Page 429
<br><br>
04 18 43 23        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Understand the general impression of being moist as it packed in the core tube. Next question: we did copy your comments prior to the EVA of your general description of the area. We wonder if either of you would have any more lengthy description or more detailed description of the general summary of the geology of the area. Over.
<br><br>
04 18 44 01        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font> (TRANQ)<br>
Yes let's - we'll - We'll postpone our answer to that one until tomorrow. Okay?
<br><br>
04 18 44 08        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Yes, indeed. That'll be fine. Just a couple more here, and I think these may not be quite as lengthy as number 7 there. Can you estimate the stroke of the primary and secondary struts? Over.
<br><br>
04 18 44 31        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font> (TRANQ)<br>
Well, I could do it like this, Owen. About all the struts are about equally stroked, and the height from the ground to the first step is about 3 feet or maybe 3 and 1/2 feet, huh?
<br><br>
04 18 44 52        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Understand, Neil. Next topic, as - just after landing, you pointed out that there was a hill to the west along the plus Z axis from the LM. Are there any large rocks in that direction that might block the solar ray during the sunset - as sunset approaches in your locality - Are there any large rocks that might tend to obscure the ray? Over.
<br><br>
04 18 45 32        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font> (TRANQ)<br>
No. I don't believe so, I think that it's - It's about as level as any other areas that we chose.
<br><br>
04 18 45 46        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. I - -
<br><br>
04 18 45 47        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font> (TRANQ)<br>
There's nothing large, anyway, that's going to get in the way.
<br><br>
04 18 45 50        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Copy. That's also the way it appeared from the television, I think. And now the final question. You commented, Neil, that on your approach to the landing spot, you had passed over a football field sized crater containing rather large blocks of solid rock perhaps 10 to 15 feet in size. Can you estimate the distance to this football sized crater from your present position? Over.
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape74/8 Page 430
<br><br>
04 18 46 25        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font> (TRANQ)<br>
I thought we'd be close enough so that when we got outside we could see its rim back there but I couldn't. But I don't think that we're more than a half mile beyond it. That is a half mile west of it.
<br><br>
04 18 46 45        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. So you estimate your present position less than half a mile approximately west of this large crater. Over.
<br><br>
04 18 46 56        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font> (TRANQ)<br>
That's correct.
<br><br>
04 18 46 58        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Okay. Well, that takes care of the questions from our geologists for tonight, and unless you have something else, that'll be all for - from us for the evening. Over.
<br><br>
04 18 47 12        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font> (TRANQ)<br>
Okay. Thank you.
<br><br>
04 18 49 01        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

<br><br>
04 18 49 14        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font> (TRANQ)<br>
Roger. Will do.
<br><br>

<br><br>

Go ahead, Houston.
<br><br>
04 18 52 28        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Two more verifications, here. Can you - will you verify that the disk with messages was placed on the surface as planned, and also that the items listed in the flight plan - all of those listed there were jettisoned. Over.
<br><br>
04 18 52 48        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font> (TRANQ)<br>
That's - All that's verified.
<br><br>
04 18 52 51        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

Hey, Mike, how's it going this morning?
<br><br>

How goes it?
<br><br>
05 00 59 18        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Hey, real fine. While you're - -
<br><br>
05 00 59 20        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font> (COLUMBIA)<br>
I don't know yet, how's it going with you?
<br><br>
05 00 59 23        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Real fine here. Columbia, request P00 and ACCEPT. We'll shove the state vector in for you right away.
<br><br>
05 00 59 57        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Okay. It's coming up now, Columbia. We're going to keep you a little busy here. As soon as we get the state vector in, we'd like you to go ahead and do a P52 option 3 on this night pass, and then when you come on around the other side there, we'll give you some landmark tracking information on prime 130.
<br><br>
05 01 00 29        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font> (COLUMBIA)<br>
Okay.
<br><br>
05 01 00 34        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
And for your information, we're also going to have Tranquility Base do a P52 when you come around the other time; and I have the P22 information if you're ready to copy.
<br><br>
05 01 00 54        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font> (COLUMBIA)<br>
Go ahead.
<br><br>
05 01 00 56        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Okay. Track landmark 130 prime using P22, and for information, this will properly position your rendezvous radar transponder. T1 is 122 plus 16 plus 05 - whoops, okay. Stand by.

<br><br>
05 01 05 09        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. I have the T1 and T2 times and also the longitude of the 130 prime. We're working on the grid squares and we'll get them shortly.
<br><br>
05 01 05 26        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font> (COLUMBIA)<br>
Okay. Ready to copy.
<br><br>
05 01 05 28        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Okay. T1: 122 plus 16 plus 05. Tango 2 is 122 plus 21 plus 11, and 6 miles north of track. And do you want your NOUN 89 values?
<br><br>
05 01 05 58        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font> (COLUMBIA)<br>
Yes, please.
<br><br>
05 01 06 00        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

<br><br>
05 01 06 51        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Columbia, affirmative. And at the T1 time, put your rendezvous radar transponder switch to OPERATE.
<br><br>
05 01 07 05        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font> (COLUMBIA)<br>
All right.
<br><br>
05 01 07 06        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
And this 130 prime is the same one that you tracked prior to descent. Over.
<br><br>
05 01 07 23        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font> (COLUMBIA)<br>
Okay. You've updated your information as to the LM's position and this is your best estimate of where the LM is, is that correct?
<br><br>
05 01 07 37        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Columbia, that's negative. This 130 is the little bitty crater there that you tracked - John Young's crater - that you tracked prior to descent. And we want that - -
<br><br>
05 01 07 50        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font> (COLUMBIA)<br>
Fine. Okay. You've given up looking for that.

on the ascent engine cover, and I curled up on the floor. Over.
<br><br>
05 01 41 14        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Copy, Buzz. Got a couple of changes to your surface checklist here, and in general, what we're going to want you to do is P22, tracking the command module for one last hack on your position there. And this will be - in other words, P57, P22, and then to press on with the checklist, and the rest of them are a couple of minor changes in the checklist. The main one being that we do not want the rendezvous radar on during the ascent, and we think that this will take care of some of the overflow of program alarms which we're getting during descent.
<br><br>
05 01 42 05        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font> (TRANQ)<br>
Okay. We had the rendezvous radar in SLEW during descent, though.
<br><br>
05 01 42 14        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Tranquility Base, Houston. I missed that. Say again.
<br><br>
05 01 42 21        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font> (TRANQ)<br>
Roger. I say again. We had the rendezvous radar switch in the SLEW position, not the LGC position.
<br><br>
05 01 42 33        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. We copy that. But there's a greater duty cycle on - There's a good 15 percent duty cycle on the ascent program there, so just go ahead and leave it off. And I have the changes there if you want to get out your surface checklist, and I can go ahead and start giving them to you.
<br><br>
05 01 42 59        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font> (TRANQ)<br>
All right. Go ahead. I've got it out.
<br><br>
05 01 43 01        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

<br><br>
05 01 43 23        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font> (TRANQ)<br>
Now you've got P00 and DATA.
<br><br>

<br><br>
05 01 43 44        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
That's affirmative. So on Surface 50 there, down at the bottom of the page, just after PRO after two recycles, stick in a time of 122 plus 15; do P22 as per PGNS 20 of G&N dictionary. Over.

<br><br>
05 01 51 21        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. We agree wholeheartedly. And while you're starting on that, I'll read - just read these notes on P22. Call P22 possible program alarm 5.6, range greater than 400 nautical miles, and then use the P22 as described on PGNS 20. Take option 1 in NOUN 06, and use the no update mode. The rendezvous radar will lock on at about 25 degrees elevation above the horizon. If 503 alarm occurs, designate fail. Key a PROCEED and allow the rendezvous radar to search for the CSM. And place the range altitude monitor switch in altitude/altitude rate to prevent the tape meter from driving into the stops. And press on.

And, Houston, Tranquility Base is going to give you a few comments with regard to the geology question of last night. We are landed in a relatively smooth crater field of elongate secondary - circular secondary craters, most of which have rims irrespective of their - raised rims irrespective of their size. That's'not universally true. There are - There are a few of the smaller craters around which do not have a discernable rim. The ground mass throughout the area is a very fine sand to a silt. I'd say the thing that would be most like it on Earth is powdered graphite. Immersed in this ground mass are a wide variety of rock shapes, sizes, textures, rounded and angular, many with varying consistencies. As I said, I've seen plain - what looked to be plain basalt and vesicular basalt. Others with no crystals, some with small white phenocrysts, maybe one to less than 5 percent. And the bould - we are in a boulder field where the boulders range generally up to 2 feet with a few larger than that. Now, some of the boulders are lying on top of the surface, some are partially exposed, and some are just barely exposed. And in our traverse around on the surface and particularly working with the scoop, we've run into boulders below the surface - it was probably buried under several inches of the ground mass.

Tranquility, Houston. Roger. Very fine description.
<br><br>
05 03 13 05        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font> (TRANQ)<br>
I suspect this boulder field may have some of its origin with this large sharp edged rocky rim crater that we passed over at final descent. Now yesterday I said that was about the size of a football field, and I have to admit it was a little - little hard to measure coming in. But I thought that it might just fit in the Astrodome as we came by it. And the rocks in the vicinity of the - of this rocky rim crater are much larger than these in this area. Some are 10 feet or so and perhaps bigger, and they are very thickly populated out to about one crater diameter beyond the crater rim. Beyond that, there is some diminishing, and even out in this area the blocks seem to run out in rows with irregular patterns, and then there are paths between them where there are considerably less surface evidence of hard rocks. Over.

Okay. The CSI burn was on scheduled time of 125 19 3470, 51.5 feet per second was our solution. After chasing residuals a little bit, we ended up with a minus 0.2, plus 0.7, and minus 0.1. And in the AGS, at that time, we had plus 0.4, plus 0.9, and plus 0.3.

No. There was no plane change on CSI, and CSM had a 2.3 foot per second burn. We had a 2.9, and we elected to postpone that. Over.

<br><br>
05 06 01 24        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font> (EAGLE)<br>
That's affirmative. We started getting an erratic indication on primary, so we switched to secondary, and it was again erratic and I thought it might have been a sensor. But it's settled down now, and we're on the secondary. Over.

That was a funny one. You know, I didn't feel it shock, and I thought things were pretty steady. I went to RETRACT there, and that's when all hell broke loose. Were you guys - did it appear to you to be - that you were jerking around quite a bit during the retrack cycle?
<br><br>
05 08 04 50        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Yes. It seemed to happen at the time I put the plus X thrust to it, and apparently it wasn't centered, because somehow or other I accidentally got off in attitude and then the attitude hold system started firing.
<br><br>

Okay. Mike, you can maneuver to your preliminary TEI attitude as shown on page 398 of the flight plan, and the high gain angles are good as shown in the flight plan, and we'd like you to dump the waste water at 131 05 down to 10 percent. Over.

Okay. Understand. I'm going to go to roll 1.1, pitch zero - or 52.6, and yaw 13.8, and you want a waste water dump 10 percent starting at 131 05.
<br><br>
05 10 35 28        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

You're loud and clear, Charlie. What - What numbers are you looking at for TEI TIG preliminary; 135 hours 23 minutes, something like that?
<br><br>
05 10 47 05        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
That's affirmative, Mike. We're looking at about nominal time. We've considered kicking it up a REV, but we don't think this REV track is going to be any good since we had the RCS burn and we need some more tracking to get you a good TEI. Over.
<br><br>
05 10 47 26        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
That's what we're looking for.

<br><br>
05 10 47 39        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. Looks like it's going to be pretty relaxed time here for the next couple of hours. We'll have you a PAD, of course, the next REV or so, and we'll keep you posted on TEI. Looks like nominal time. Over.
<br><br>

Thank you, Charlie.

Roger, Neil. Starting off: Congratulatory messages on the Apollo 11 mission have been pouring into the White House from world leaders in a steady stream all day. Among the latest are telegrams from Prime Minister Harold Wilson of Great Britain and the King of Belgium. The world's press has been dominated by news of Apollo 11. Some newsmen estimate that more than 60 percent of the news used in papers across the country today concerned your mission. The New York Times which, as we mentioned before, has had such a demand for its edition of the paper today (even though it ran 950 000 copies) said it will reprint the whole thing on Thursday as a souvenir edition. And Premier Alexei Kosygin has sent congratulations to you and President Nixon through former Vice President Humphrey who is visiting Russia. The cosmonauts have also issued a statement of congratulations. Humphrey quoted Kosygin as saying "I want you to tell the President and the American people that the Soviet Union desires to work with the United States in the cause of peace."

And Mrs. Robert Goddard said today that her husband would have been so happy. "He wouldn't have shouted or anything. He would just have glowed." She added, "That was his dream, sending a rocket to the Moon." People around the world had many reasons to be happy about the Apollo 11 mission. The Italian police reported that Sunday night was the most crime free night of the year. And in London, a boy who had the faith to bet $5 with a bookie that a man would reach the Moon before 1970 collected $24.000. That's pretty good odds.

You're probably interested in the comments your wives have made. Neil, Jan had said about yesterday's activities, "The evening was unbelievably perfect. It is an honor and a privilege to share with my husband, the crew, the Manned Spacecraft Center, the American public, and all mankind; the magnificent experience of the beginning of lunar exploration." She was then asked if she considered the Moon landing the greatest moment in her life. She said "No, that was the day we were married." And Mike, Pat said simply, "It was fantastically marvelous." Buzz, Joan said - apparently couldn't quite believe the EVA on the Moon. She said, "It was hard to think it was real until the men actually moved. After the Moon touchdown, I wept because I was so happy." But she added, "The best part of the mission will be the splashdown."

In other news, and there was a little bit, another explorer: Thor Heyerdahl had to give up his attempt to sail a papyrus boat across the Atlantic. The storm damaged boat was abandoned about 650 miles from Bermuda. The speed of the craft had been reduced to about 25 miles a day, and Heyerdahl said the object of the voyage had not been to provide an endurance test for the crew.

Looking at the world of sports, let's see here. While you were busy the other day, Joe Namath and football Commissioner Pete Rozelle made the announcement that "Broadway Joe" had agreed to sell his interest in the Bachelors III restaurant and report to the New York Jets. Joe arrived at the Jets' training camp today and had his first workout. Several other Jet players who had held out along with Joe also reported. And Davy Hill, from Jackson, Michigan, won his third major golf in as many starts in the past week. He won the Philadelphia Classic. Hill has won four tournaments so far this year and is the leading money winner this year with a cool $129.000. And in baseball, the west division of the National League remains a tight race. LA and San Francisco are one game behind league leading Atlanta. The Astros have a record of 48 wins and 48 losses, and are now in fifth place, seven games out. A twin bill between the Astros and Cincinnati last night was postponed because of rain. The Chicago Cubs
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 85/3 Page 500
<br><br>
are still in first place in the East Division. They lead the New York Mets by four and one half games. And in the American League, Baltimore is breezing toward the Eastern Division title. They lead second place Boston by 11 games. Looking ahead, the All Star baseball game is scheduled for tomorrow. And President Nixon was scheduled to see the game and then leave immediately after the game for the Pacific splashdown area before going on his tour of Europe. And that about covers the news this day. You guys have been making most of it and I'm sure we couldn't fill you in on any of the details that you don't already know. Out.

Yes, we did. Based on your very excellent briefing I was expecting the thing to continue desiring increase for the whole time, so we started out with it in INCREASE. I saw that we pretty quickly crossed the line and started falling about 6 or 7 percent behind, so I was still expecting it to move up, and then I went down to FULL DECREASE and brought it back down to a difference of 2 percent.

<br><br>
05 16 28 21        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Yes. The transients were more noticeable than on the previous burns, Charlie. I just wrote it off on the fact we had a light command module, but there was considerable roll activity which dampened down after the first 20 seconds, I would guess, of the burn; but then there was also some pitch and yaw activity. I don't believe it was abnormal, and it seemed to be deadbanding ratherly crisply in roll plus or minus about 8 degrees either side of the center line; and after the
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 88/2 Page 509
<br><br>
first couple of - oh, after the first 20 seconds or so, the gimbals were quiet, and pitch and yaw were relatively quiet. Before that, there was some oscillation but mostly just in rates. Total attitude hung in there pretty well.

Roger, Neil. We're seeing some temperature rises on the passive seismic experiment that are a little higher than normal and were wondering if you could verify the deployed position. We understand it's about 40 feet from the LM in the eleven o'clock position. Over.
<br><br>
05 17 17 37        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
No. It's about in the nine or nine thirty position, and I'd say it's about 50 or 60 feet.

05 17 18 02        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Not very much. There was quite a bit of Kapton and parts of the LM that went out in all directions, usually for great distances, as far as I can tell. But I don't remember seeing anything of a dust cloud to speak of.
<br><br>
05 17 18 21        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Understand all you could see was parts of the LM going out. What was your - your first - first comment? Over.
<br><br>
05 17 18 35        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
I don't remember. Just that the Kapton and other parts on the LM staging scattering all around the area for great distances, but I didn't see much dust.

Roger, Charlie. Like to bring you up to date on our chlorination status. In compartment B4, we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven - correction, we have eight pockets for chlorine and buffer ampules, of which - Let me correct that. We have seven pockets, of which one is empty and always has been empty, leaving six remaining. On the other side over there in B7, we have another container with seven pockets, so we have a total of seven plus six, and those are filled with six chlorines and seven buffers. Now, I've been using one chlorine and one buffer per day which, at this point in time, prior to
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 88/6 Page 513

this chlorination I'm about to do, leaves me one chlorine and two buffers. Seems to me I'm one chlorine short, and that being the case, I'd like to ask your advice on postponing this chlorination using the last container until some later date, like maybe tomorrow. Over.

Roger. From the hot wires of the Public Affairs Office: Apollo 11 still dominates the news around the world. Only four nations, Communist China, North Korea, North Viet Nam, and Albania, have not yet informed their citizens of your flight and landing on the Moon. One newsman said that he has run out of ways to describe your success. Tonight, President Nixon is scheduled to watch the All Star baseball game in Washington. After the game, he will depart for the Pacific recovery area. Wednesday evening, he will fly from Johnston Island by helicopter to the Navy communications ship Arlington. Then on Thursday morning, he will reboard the helicopter and fly to the Hornet in time to witness your splashdown. Accompanying the President will be Secretary of State William Rogers and Frank Borman. They will watch the splashdown from the bridge of the recovery ship with Admiral John Sidney McCain, Jr., Commander of the Pacific Forces. Following the President's stay aboard the Hornet, he will depart for his tour of Asia and scheduled visit to Romania. Luna 15 is believed to have crashed into the Sea of Crises yesterday after orbiting the Moon 52 times. The Soviet News Agency TASS reported that "scientific"
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 95/4 Page 524
<br><br>
"research in near Moon space was carried out." Sir Bernard Lovell at Jodrell Bank Observatory said that Luna 15 hit the surface of the Moon at a speed of about 300 miles per hour. Things have been relatively quiet recently in Viet Nam. GI's on patrol were observed carrying transistor radios tuned into your flight. The Armed Forces radio and TV network in Viet Nam gave the mission full coverage. Skirmishes still continue between the Egyptians and Israelis along the Suez Canal. U.N. observers there are trying to halt the action. In Washington, the House Ways and Means Committee has voted to reduce the 27.5 percent oil depletion allowance to 20 percent. We've had rain several times here in the Houston area. Today it is cloudy, and more showers are expected. On the sports front, as we mentioned earlier, the All Star game is tonight. There were no games played yesterday. Last night in New York, the Baseball Writers Association of America named Babe Ruth the greatest ball player of all time. Joe DiMaggio was named the greatest living ball player. Frank Borman made the announcements at a dinner honoring the players. Joe Namath put in a full day at the New York Jets' training camp. Five policemen had a hard time restraining about 500 kids who wanted to touch Broadway Joe. He said he feels fine and will play in the All Star game August 1, if Coach Weeb Eubank lets him. The Oilers' camp at Kerrville got wet yesterday, but the workouts continued. There have been some minor injuries, but nothing too serious. Coach Wally Lemm is satisfied so far with the workouts. The Oilers are expecting attendance by over 30.000 for the preseason game with Buffalo. Apparently, Don Meredith's announced retirement isn't expected to dampen enthusiasm, especially around here in Houston. Mario Andretti won the 200 mile Trenton Auto Race Sunday and is now the leading race driver in the U.S. Auto Club's point standings. And that's about the summary of the morning news this afternoon in Houston. Over.

Roger. With respect to the Dow Jones industrials, since closing on Tuesday afternoon the 15th up to about 1:05 p.m. Houston time this afternoon, why, the effect has been a net drop; that is, minus 6 points on the industrial average. So far today since opening, the Dow Jones industrial average has gone down by 11.05 after rising 1 1/2 shortly after opening. Today's performance on the utilities is a drop of 1.63, and railroads a drop of 1.58. Over.

<br><br>
06 04 44 40        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

<br><br>

Apollo 11, this is Houston. If you have a minute or so free, I wonder if we could get Mike to give us a little bit of clarification on what happened around about the time of docking. We copied him as mentioning that contact was very smooth, almost imperceptible; and we're a little bit inquisitive or curious about his remarks as to what happened after probe retraction. Over.
<br><br>
06 04 46 00        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Roger. I docked in CMC AUTO, and as I said, I wasn't really sure of the moment of contact. I kept cross checking the docking probe indicators. I got two barber poles indicating that the three capture latches - not capture latches, but the three ... latches had made, and we were soft
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 96/2 Page 527
<br><br>
docked. And at that time the situation looked very stable. So, I went to CMC FREE, glanced back out the window and it still looked stable; and I fired primary 2 bottle. And at that time, a gyration began between the two vehicles due I'm not sure to what. Perhaps the LM thrusting or perhaps it was building up prior, and I hadn't noticed it. But anyway, during the RETRACT of the probe, there were yaw - my yaw excursions of, I would guess, around 15 degrees, and I had to come back on, take the FREE switch and throw it back to AUTO, and try to damp them out; and I guess Neil was doing the same in the LM. I'll let him tell you about his side of it. And I though that we were not going to get a successful RETRACT and hard dock. However, in about - oh, I guess 6 or 8 seconds, I did hear - could see the situation damping out, and then we heard the noise indicating the docking latches had fired; and later on when I got into the tunnel, all 12 of them had properly engaged.

06 04 47 49        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
And on the LM side, we were in AGS MIN deadband ATT HOLD; and at contact, I thrusted plus X; and shortly after that we had a sizable attitude oscillation and thruster firing, so we opened up the deadband to MAX and manually flew the vehicle into stable attitude during the retraction. It went to OFF after ...

06 05 03 44        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
I think only in my suit.
<br><br>
06 05 03 48        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

<br><br>
06 05 04 17        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
I think it was after insertion sometime, Bruce. I don't remember exactly when. I - It was when we were in orbit and had our - after we took our helmets off.
<br><br>
06 05 04 31        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

<br><br>
06 05 04 38        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
I'd guess it might have been probably 20 minutes after I noticed it that I mentioned it to you.
<br><br>
06 05 04 44        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Was this noticing the water accompanied by erratic CO2 partial pressure readings, or was that a separate problem? Over.

<br><br>
06 05 04 57        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>

<br><br>
06 05 05 06        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. And what was the relative sequence on selecting water separator number 2 and the secondary CO2 canister; that is, did you go to the secondary water separator first and then the secondary CO2? Over.
<br><br>
06 05 05 27        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
I believe we went to secondary CO2 first.
<br><br>
06 05 05 33        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Secondary hydroxide - lithium hydroxide.
<br><br>
06 05 05 37        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. We copy. And was there any change in your suit loop - -
<br><br>
06 05 05 40        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
No.
<br><br>
06 05 05 41        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Go ahead.
<br><br>
06 05 05 44        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
I should mention, Bruce, that when I went to water secondary - water separator to secondary there, I didn't notice any change. But about after 15 minutes or 20 minutes, the water stopped coming out. So maybe that was just water that was already in the loop that was still blowing out, but the secondary water separator was operating properly.
<br><br>
06 05 06 11        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Did you make any changes in the suit loop configuration after you went from the egress mode to the cabin mode after insertion; that is, in particular, they're interested in knowing if you recall changing the diverter valve position to EGRESS at any time while you were on the secondary canister? Over.

Apollo 11, this is Houston. While you're waiting for the CSM to settle down and for us to look at the tapes on your latest maneuver, would you feel like answering some more questions with relation to the lunar surface? Over.
<br><br>

Go ahead.

Go ahead, Houston.

06 07 33 59        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. For 64 thousand dollars, we're still trying to work out the location of your landing site, Tranquility Base. We think it is located on LAM 2 chart at Juliet 0.5 and 7.8. Do you still have those charts on board? Over.
<br><br>
06 07 34 24        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Yes. Stand by one. They're packed.

06 07 34 31        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. You may not have to unpack it. The position which I just gave you is slightly west of West Crater. I guess it's about two tenths of a kilometer west of it, and we were wondering if Neil or Buzz had observed any additional landmarks during descent, lunar stay, or ascent which would confirm or disprove this. One thing that we're wondering about is that if you were at this position, you would have seen the Cat's Paw during ascent just up to the north of your track. Over.
<br><br>
06 07 35 18        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
We were looking for the Cat's Paw, too, thinking we were probably downrange, beyond the Big V. But I think that it's likely that that might have been West Crater that we went across in landing, but - Stand by.
<br><br>
06 07 36 22        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
We're hoping, Bruce, that our 16 mm film was working at that point in descent, and we'll be able to confirm our touchdown position. We thought that during ascent we might be able to pick up some recognizable objects close to the landing site, and we did see a number of small craters, and crater rows, and things like that, which we may be able to pick out after the fact, but we haven't been able to yet.

Roger. And the next question from our panel is for Buzz. We recall that he reported seeing a laser upon AOS of the Earth the first time after - the first REV after ascent, and we're wondering what color the beam was and if he could determine at the approximate location with respect to the Earth. Over.
<br><br>
06 07 37 25        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
It was mostly white, perhaps a tinge of yellowish color to it; and it seemed to be - as I recall it, the terminator of the Earth was toward the horizon and seemed to be about a quarter to a third of the way down from - down towards the terminator of the Earth - from the opposite horizon. That's a third to a quarter Earth radii. Over.
<br><br>
06 07 38 10        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. And that puts it in the light side? Over.
<br><br>
06 07 38 18        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Roger. Yes, it was in the light side. The Earth was about - a two thirds lit Earth, with the terminator down toward the horizon. And now coming from the opposite limb of the Earth, the sunlight limb, coming down about one quarter to one third of a radius in from the limb. Generally, pensively located with respect to a line drawn perpendicular to the terminator that goes through the center. Over.

<br><br>
06 07 39 02        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
And I got pictures of that. I'm sure that will show up.
<br><br>
06 07 39 07        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
And I saw that, too. It was a very bright spot of light and I confirm Buzz's observation of its position.
<br><br>
06 07 39 15        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Okay, 11. Very good. Now, with respect to the documented sample container: on television it appeared to us as though the samples for that container were in fact being given - being selected in accordance with some thought or consideration being given to the rocks themselves. And we were wondering if you could give any further details from memory about any of these samples, and the context of the material or the surface from which they were taken. Over.
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 97/5 Page 535
<br><br>
06 07 39 56        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Yes. You remember I initially started on the cut side of the LM that the TV camera was on, and I took a number of samples of rocks on the surface, and several that were just subsurface - about 20 - 15 to 20 feet north of the LM. And then I recalled that that area had been probably swept pretty well by the exhaust of the descent engine, so I crossed over to the southern side of the LM, and took a number of samples from the area around the elongate double crater that we commented on, and several beyond that, and tried to take as many different types - of rock types as I could see by eye - as I could in the short time we had available. There were a number of other samples that I had seen earlier in our stroll around the LM that I had hoped to get back and pick up and put in the documented sample, but I didn't get those, and I'll be able to comment in detail when we get in the debriefing session.
<br><br>
06 07 41 17        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Did you observe any small craters with conspicuously blocky rims? Over.
<br><br>
06 07 41 28        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Well, aside from the one big one that we went over, I guess there were none in our area. I took a stroll back after putting up the EASEP, and while Buzz was starting to unpack the documented samples - took a stroll back to a crater behind us that was maybe 70 or 80 feet in diameter and 15 or 20 feet deep, and took some pictures of it. It had rocks in the bottom of pretty good size, considerably bigger than any that were out on the surface, but there was no - we apparently, at 15 feet or so, had not gotten below the regolith. We were essentially showing no bedrock, at least in the walls of the crater at that depth. Over.

11, we concur that having VERB 16, NOUN 20 up on the DSKY may well have had some effect on your PTC initiation. It looks like this would give - let the computer work with a knowledge of the actual CDU angles. What we'd like you to do is do a CDU zero which is VERB 40, NOUN 20, ENTER, and then start the PTC procedure again at step 2 with loading VERB 6, NOUN 22, desired attitude in the AUTO maneuver, and all that.

Mike, over here on page 9 7 of your checklist where we're setting up PTC, there's been a note penciled in after, "Wait 20 minutes for rate to damp. Do not monitor VERB 16, NOUN 20." It turns out that the significance of that is that, if you are monitoring 16 NOUN 20, then when you get down here in step 7, the second time you do a VERB 24, you've got to reload the NOUN 01 to make it VERB 24, NOUN 01, ENTER, before you load the three registers. Over.

That's a good one because it puts the Earth out window 1 and the Moon out window 3 and puts the Sun down in the LEB, so the lighting in here remains relatively constant.

We know there's a lot of scientists from a number of countries standing by to see the lunar samples, and we thought you'd be interested to see them as they really are here. These two boxes are the sample return containers. They - They're vacuum packed containers that were closed in a vacuum on the lunar surface, sealed, and then brought inside the LM and put inside these fiber glass bags, zippered, and resealed around the outside, and placed in these receptacles in the side of the command module. These are the two boxes. And as soon as we get onto the ship,
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 100/3 Page 545
<br><br>
I'm sure these boxes will immediately be transferred and delivery started to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory. These boxes include the samples of the various types of rock, the groundmass of the soil, the sand and silt, and the particle collector for the solar wind experiment, and the core tubes that took depth samples of the lunar surface.

06 11 44 47        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Roger. How am I coming through now, Charlie?
<br><br>
06 11 44 49        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. You're very clear when you come through. It's just that your VOX is not keying at every word. Over.
<br><br>
06 11 44 57        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Okay. These bite sized objects were designed to remove the problem of having so many crumbs floating around in the cabin, so they designed a particular size that would be able to go to the mouth all at once. I think since all of our experience, we've discovered that we could progress a good bit further than that back some of the type meals that we have on Earth. As a matter of fact, on this flight we've carried along pieces of bread, and along with the bread we have a ham spread; and I'll show you, I hope, how easy it is to spread some ham while I'm in zero g.
<br><br>

You can also use zero gravity to demonstrate many things that we've all learned in school. I'd like to demonstrate briefly how easy it is to explain the action of the gyroscope. If I spin this can, we know that according to the equations of motion that we would expect that once this is given a spin, and has a spin axis in this direction, if we give it a particular torque, and I'll do this by pushing my hands against it in this fashion once it's spinning. By the equations we can predict that, as I put this torque on it, it will in fact rotate this direction. Let's see how well this works out.
<br><br>

<br><br>
06 11 47 53        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
See that as I apply the torque this way, it's rotated this way.
<br><br>
06 11 48 12        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Too close, I think.
<br><br>
06 11 48 32        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. It's a pretty good demonstration.
<br><br>
06 11 48 46        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Houston, this next is a little demonstration for the kids at home, all kids everywhere, for that matter. I was going to show you how you drink water out of a spoon, but I'm afraid I filled the spoon too full and if I'm not careful, I'm going to spill water right over the sides. Can you see the water slopping around on the top of the spoon, kids?
<br><br>
06 11 49 07        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
That's affirmative, 11.
<br><br>
06 11 49 12        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Okay. Well, as I said, I was going to show you but I'm afraid I filled it too full and it's going to spill over the sides. I'll tell you what. I'll just turn this one over and get rid of the water and start all over again. Okay?
<br><br>
06 11 49 27        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Okay.
<br><br>
06 11 49 35        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
And you can see, up here we don't know where over is. One up is as good as another. That really is water, though. I'll show you.
<br><br>
06 11 50 04        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
That's really not the way we drink. We really have a water gun which I'll show you.
<br><br>
06 11 50 15        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Here's the water gun. This cylindrical thing on the end of it is a filter with several membranes: one allows water to pass, but not any gas; the other allows gas to pass, but not any water. So, by routing the gaseous water which comes from our tank through this filter, we're enabled to drink purified water without the gas in it, filtered water. And, of course, all we do to - to get it started is just pull the trigger.
<br><br>
06 11 50 58        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
It's sort of messy. I haven't been at this very long. It's sort of the same system that the Spaniards used to drink out of wineskins at bull fights, only I think this is even more fun. Well, be seeing you, kids.

It just so happens that's what we were talking about now. There is a little bit of dampness around the outside edge of the hatch, but a very, very slight amount. We've got a hose up there that we're hoping will sort of help keep it a little bit dry.

Let's see, right now in the mid - yes, at the MPL - we've got 3000 scattered, visibility 10, waves height 3 feet, is the present weather.

are a couple of tropical storms in the - well, not in the area of landing but in the Pacific. A storm called Claudia which is north - correction - about east of Hawaii. It's going northwest and dissipating. And there's one called Viola, which is out over Guam, and so they aren't any factor at all. It looks like it's going to be real nice for recovery.

11, Houston. The RETRO's were wondering if you could fill us in on any non nominal stowage that we have on board. Just location and weight is about all they're interested in. Over.
<br><br>
06 12 14 12        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Roger. We'll do some work on that and let you know, Charlie.

Thank you, sir.

What we'll do Charlie, tomorrow, is go through and reconfigure our stowage as closely as possible to nominal. Some things that will not be nominal are as follows: the EVA visors were brought back into the command module, and we have not yet found a home for them. We'll let you know where they go. In addition, there's about 5 pounds of miscellaneous weight from the LM

in compartment Able 8, and it's taking the place of the LCG's which we moved from A 8 into the suit bag. We got rid of one miscellaneous trash bag, mostly old food wrapping and also old underwear and that helmet protective visor of the CMP's. We left all that with Eagle. And those are about the only off nominals we have.

And Buzz, we're still not getting any data from your EKG. It looks like the only way that we're going to be able to get any is if, at your convenience, you would take your - change out your EKG leads, which are the center ones that are connected to the blue pin; and there's a spare one in the medical box. Over.

Roger. How many did you want me to change?
<br><br>
06 12 22 57        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Just the center one. I'll get the right nomenclature from the Doc. Stand by. It's called the sternal EKG, which are the three center ones, and it's got - they lead into a - into the blue stringed lead ones. Over.

Apollo 11, Houston. Based on our sighting since the midcourse, we're showing a gamma of minus 6.57. This is preliminary, though, and we think that after some more tracking it should come on in, and we could tweak it right on into the corridor. It's just about in the center of the corridor; everything's looking fine. We'll have you an entry PAD in a couple of hours before you go to sleep. And from our friends in public affairs, a few headlines, other than your flight. You're still dominating the news. However, there are some other things of interest for you. As I mentioned earlier, the All Star game was rained out. It's going to be played tomorrow. However, President Nixon will not be able to see it as he planned. We'll keep you posted on results. And, also, the weathermen are going to be good to you. Our forecast is, looks like it's holding good for the recovery area; it should be real fine out there.

your return, predicted that within 31 years man will have visited at least one other planet bearing some form of life. "In the year 2000, we, on this Earth, will have visited new worlds where there will be a form of life," he told 2000 foreign exchange students at the White House. Before he left for his week long trip, the President sent Congress his proposal for organizing - reorganizing the Interstate Commerce Commission. He also conferred with chairman Earl Wheeler of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on his return from Viet Nam, and the launch of Intelstat was scrubbed and has been rescheduled for 10 p.m., eastern daylight time on Wednesday. The second stage fuel ground support system showed some contamination.

Apollo 11, Houston. I was just reading some of the transcripts of earlier today about this earlier PTC that we attempted, and when you keyed into VERB 24 and did the two ENTER's, it took off on you. I think we got a story on that, if you'd like to listen to why it had such a high rate, Mike. Over.

Okay.

Then when you did the VERB 24, ENTER, you were really entering the information in the actual CDU; and when you got the two entries in, in register 1 and 2, it was an - it was an instantaneous change in the actual CDU, and the CM DAP looked at that and saw - saw what it thought it

had. My - my gosh, I got a 600 degree per second rate. And it turns on the jets to try to take that rate out. And the rate filters that it's looking at - it - well, the rate it's looking at is filtered, so it doesn't really sense the actual rate until the thing is already built up, and then it starts reading the rate filters, and it says, "Well, I really didn't have 600 degrees." So then it turns it off and tries to slow it down. But until that happens, and it is some time lag, and that's why the rate was building up. The jets were on, and they were going to stay on due to that instantaneous 600 - suspected 600 degree per second rate. Over.

But when he did that second VERB 24, you were - the NOUN was 20, so when he did the 3175 and then a 002 ENTER, what he actually did there was load the first two actual CDU locations, and the computer looked at it - the DAP looked at it as an instantaneous change in the actual CDU. Stand by on your comments. We're switching antennas.

<br><br>
06 14 24 51        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Yes. I think so. I - I thought maybe that NOUN 20 was one of those that you could never load from the DSKY, and that still maybe. Maybe it was loaded just for the short period of time, and then when the counters read the - the gimbal angles, why they changed it back to what they actually are. But in the meantime, the DAP saw this different number. Is that right?

Well, our guidance guy was telling me that you can actually load those ACDU's, the actual CDU's, but we'll - we're checking on that. Over.

Okay.
<br><br>
06 14 25 42        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. Buzz, the word from the back room is that you can actually load the NOUN 20, but you should not.

Okay. We'd like - the SPAN guys say it looks - they think that one would go on the helmet that you're going to have in B1, and you could put the other one on Mike's helmet, which will be in the sleep restraint. Over.
<br><br>
06 14 34 01        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
I doubt if it will fit on the helmet in B1. The other one might - might go in the sleep restraint. We've got them in our helmet bags, and I guess we're going to have to keep the helmets in the helmet bags, and the LEVVA's in the LEVVA bags.

*** Three asterisks denote clipping of words and phrases.
<br><br>

to do it on our marks from the ground. The PTC is a little bit ragged, and we would like to make the water dump at a time which we think will hold it in its proper configuration, so it looks like we'll have a desirable opportunity coming along in - between 15 and 20 minutes.

11, Houston. Present forecast shows acceptable conditions in your recovery area: 2000 foot scattered, high scattered, wind from 070 degrees, 13 knots, visibility 10 miles, and sea state about 4 feet. The forecast yesterday showed a tropical storm, Claudia, some 500 to 1000 miles east of Hawaii. The - the pictures from Earth satellites taken yesterday afternoon - afternoon showed Claudia dissipating, so this appears to be even less a factor than it was before. Your recovery area is now believed to be just a little ways north of the intertropical convergence zone, which you can probably see when you look out your windows there. Yesterday there was also a report of a tropical storm, Viola, further to the west. Its present location is some thousand miles east of the Phillipines and moving northwest. Tropical storm Viola has been intensifying, and should be transferred to the typhoon category within the next 12 hours or so; however, that will be far to your west. As a matter of fact, sunrise terminator has not yet reached Viola. When it does several hours from now, you can probably distinguish it from your viewpoint quite readily. As a matter of fact it should be of interest to perhaps take some pictures. Comment on it when you get a chance to see Viola in a few hours. So that's about the present weather state and situation for your recovery area. Over.

Peculiar thing, Owen, on the platform alignment is that when I really take my time and do a very slow, careful, precise job of marking. I'm getting about the same star angle difference as when I'm doing it in DTC and have to do a hurried rush job with relatively poor tracking. Star angle differences seem insensitive. It almost made me believe there's a very small bias there somewhere in the sextant.
<br><br>
07 06 02 07        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

<br><br>
07 06 02 20        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
I think Buzz is probably right. As a matter of fact, one time I made a mark which I thought was a little bit in error, but I tho thought, "Well heck. I'll go ahead and see how it works out anyway," and I got five zeros that time. And when I have thought everything was exactly precisely on, I have consistently been getting 0.01.

I usually do.
<br><br>
07 06 03 07        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
The visibility through the telescope has been very poor. It's, I would say, even worse than the simulator is right now. It requires long periods of dark adaptation which most times are most inconvenient; so it's really a tremendous asset to keep the platform powered up at all times and to keep it tweaked within the capability of the sextant field of view.
<br><br>

<br><br>
07 06 05 07        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

07 06 05 59        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. It looks like we'll have to think a little more about that, as to whether it's a LM off or some effect of being out of Lunar orbit. We don't know, so we'll have to puzzle before we can give a better answer.

11, this is Houston. With reference to your subjective evaluation that it felt cooler in side the spacecraft last night, we reported earlier that we did indeed see a drop of about 3 degrees over the previous night. Looking back, it appears the crew of Apollo 10 reported similar feelings during the translunar and transearth coast phases. We're wondering if you could give us any indication of the relative amounts of free or condensed water in the cabin last night and the night before from which we could infer humidity. Over.
<br><br>
07 06 27 27        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Roger. That might be a little bit difficult to do. We'll take a look at the tunnel now. It does seem as though, between the dirt, we had a little bit more moisture in the tunnel. Of course, the LM hadn't been vented when we did translunar.
<br><br>
07 06 27 45        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. We were more curious about the relative amount of moisture between, say, last night and the night before, both of which would have the LM missing.
<br><br>
07 06 28 04        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
There's more moisture in the tunnel now than there has been at any previous time. Subjectively we have been unable to determine any change in - any buildup in humidity. There appears to be no moisture any other place in the spacecraft. For example, the windows are not fogging or - and various other cool spots around the spacecraft - all of them appear to be completely dry.

Roger. This trip of ours to the Moon may have looked, to you, simple or easy. I'd like to assure you that has not been the case. The Saturn V rocket which put us into orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly. This computer up above my head has a 38,000 word vocabulary, each word of which has been very carefullly chosen to be of the utmost value to us, the crew. This switch which I have in my hand now, has over 300 counterparts in the command module alone, this one single switch design. In addition to that, there are myriads of circuit breakers, levers, rods, and other associated controls. The SPS engine, our large rocket engine on the aft end of our service module, must have performed flawlessly, or we would have been stranded in lunar orbit. The parachutes up above my head must work perfectly tomorrow or we will plummet into the
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 114/3 Page 589
<br><br>
ocean. We have always had confidence that all this equipment will work, and work properly, and we continue to have confidence that it will do so for the remainder of the flight. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of people. First, the American workmen who put these pieces of machinery together in the factory. Second, the painstaking work done by the various test teams during the assembly and retest after assembly. And finally, the people at the Manned Spacecraft Center, both in management, in mission planning, in flight control, and last, but not least, in crew training. This operation is somewhat like the periscope of a submarine. All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all those, I would like to say, thank you very much.

<br><br>
07 09 38 20        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Good evening. I'd like to discuss with you a few of the more symbolic aspects of the flight of our mission, Apollo 11. As we've been discussing the events that have taken place in the past 2 or 3 days here on board our spacecraft, we've come to the conclusion that this has been far more than three men on a voyage to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown. Neil's statement the other day upon first setting foot on the surface of the Moon, "This is a small step for a man, but a great leap for mankind," I believe sums up these feelings very nicely. We accepted the challenge of going to the Moon; the acceptance of this challenge was inevitable. The relative ease with which we carried out our mission, I believe, is a tribute to the timeliness of that acceptance. Today, I feel we're fully capable of accepting expanded roles in the exploration of space. In retrospect, we have all been particularly pleased with the call signs that we very laboriously
<br><br>
<br><br>(GOSS NET 1) Tape 114/4 Page 590
<br><br>
chose for our spacecraft, Columbia and Eagle. We've been particularly pleased with the emblem of our flight, depicting the U.S. eagle bringing the universal symbol of peace from the Earth, from the planet Earth to the Moon; that symbol being the olive branch. It was our overall crew choice to deposit a replica of this symbol on the Moon. Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind to me. "When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars which Thou hast ordained, what is man that Thou art mindful of him."
<br><br>
07 09 41 42        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
The responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have through their will, indicated their desire; next, to four administrations, and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, to the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the space suit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give a special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft, who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their - their hearts and all their abilities into those crafts. To those people, tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.

Roger. At 180 hours 50 minutes GET, we should like to delete your oxygen fuel cell purge.
<br><br>
07 09 54 02        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Okay.
<br><br>
07 09 54 03        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
And on the entry photography, if you are going to use a fresh magazine of color interior film, we recommend the following exposure settings: f11 at 1/250, six frames per second, focus on 7 feet for the fireball; f2.0, 1/60 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 50 feet when the chutes open. If you are using a magazine, part of which has already been used for interior shots, we recommend f16 at 1/500 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 7 feet for the fireball; f2.8, 1/60 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 50 feet when the parachutes open. And we would like to know the magazine number that you are intending to use if you have a chance. Over.
<br><br>
07 09 55 22        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Okay. I think we got those. We will be using a fresh one and it will be color interior. Over.
<br><br>
07 09 55 32        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. When you get - get it out, we would like to have the number of the magazine and the letter of the magazine relayed down.
<br><br>
07 09 55 42        <font color="0000FF">CDR</font><br>
Okay. And we're thinking that we might want to run some of that at 12 frames per second. And I think we can get everything from 0.5 - 0.5g down; that will only give us about 7.8 minutes and ... frames ... double that. I guess maybe just an occasional burst to 12 frames would be what we want and the rest of it at six. Over.
<br><br>

And lastly, we would like to know if your stowage configuration for entry is going to conform to

In compartment A1, the 16 millimeter magazine will be located in window number 4 instead of 5. Tissue dispensers; there is only one of them left. And compartment U3, the 16 millimeter bracket is on window 4, and the PGA bag - add the CMP's PGA, plus add two LCG's. And compartment A8 delete two LCG's, add one PPK, making a total of four, and add 10 pounds of LM miscellaneous equipment. We told you five the other day. We think ten is probably closer. Over.

On your next page, in compartment B1, we estimate about 15 percent of that food is remaining. In B2 we took PPK out of there and put trash in it. In B3, the 16 millimeter cable, the 18 millimeter lens, and the right angle mirror are on window number 4. And that there brings you all up to date.

They're in the hatch bag.
<br><br>
07 13 39 56        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. Stand by. Our only concern, 11, is with the stuff you got in the hatch bag. That's pretty big bulk between you and A8, and we'd like to talk about moving that over to the sleep restraint. If you will stand by. I'll verify that. Over.
<br><br>
07 13 40 16        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Okay.
<br><br>
07 13 41 16        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. Our recommendation on the gear you got in the helmet bag - correction, hatch bag, would be to remove that stuff and put it in the sleep restraint under the right couch. The reason is that the hatch bag straps are only configured for zero g, and it is a pretty difficult job getting it lashed down. With the gear in the sleep restraint, it's a pretty standard lash down procedure, and you could also use the Beta cord that you have on hoard. You concur? Over.
<br><br>
07 13 42 03        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Yes. We'll look at it, Charlie, and let you know.
<br><br>
07 13 42 06        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Roger. And I got a couple of other things, Mike. We need to terminate battery B charge at this time, and also, the weather is clobbering in at our targeted landing point due to scattered thunderstorms. We don't want to tangle with one of those, so we are going to move the - your aim point uprange. Correction, it will be downrange, to target for 1500 nautical mile entry so we can guarantee uplift control. The new coordinates are 13 degrees, 19 minutes north, 169 10 minutes west. The weather in that area is super. We got 2000 scattered, 8000 scattered with 10 miles visibility and 6 foot seas and the Hornet is sitting in great position to get to that targeted positton. Over.

Okay. Apollo 11 remains the prime story with the world awaiting your landing today at about 11 49 a.m. Houston time. In Washington, House tax reformers have fashioned a provision which would make it impossible for wealthy individuals to avoid income tax entirely through tax free investments or special allowances. Under the proposal tentatively adopted by the House Ways and Means Committee, everyone would pay taxes on at least half of their income.

Roger. Continuing with the Maroon Bugle. President Nixon surprised your wives with a phone call from San Francisco just before he boarded a plane to fly out to meet you. All of them were very touched by your television broadcast. Jan and Pat watched from Mission Control here. The launch of Intelsat from the Cape was postponed for the fourth time last night. The problem was said to be a malfunctioning nitrogen regulator in the second stage of Delta. A new attempt will be made to launch it tonight. The research submarine Ben Franklin, which is studying the Gulf Stream, set a record by drifting 24 hours from 10 to 100 feet above the ocean floor in 1300 feet of water off the Georgia coast. The mission is led by Jacques Picard. Wally Schirra has been elected to a 5 year term on the board of trustees of the Detroit Institute of Technology. He will serve on the Institute's development committee. Air Canada says it has accepted 2300 reservations for flights to the Moon in the past 5 days. It might be noted that more than 100 have been made by men for their mothers in law. And finally, it appears that rather than killing romantic songs about the Moon, you have inspired hundreds of song writers. Nashville, Tennessee, which probably houses the largest collection of recording companies and song publishers in the country, now reports it is being flooded by Moon songs. Some will make it. The song at the top of the best sellers list this week is, "In the year 2525." Morning Bugle. Out.

Okay. Go ahead.
<br><br>
07 23 51 14        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Okay. On page E6 1, your RRT is 07 20, your 50K is 08 16; 40K is 08 30; your 24K is 09 02; and your 10K is 09 51. 0ver.
<br><br>

Okay. RRT, 07 20, 50 000, 08 16. That's - 07 20 is - is the time of steam pressure peg from RRT; and 40 000, 08 30; 24 000, 09 02; 10 000, 09 51.

<br><br>
07 23 52 58        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
I assume that - all I wanted to know is that first time, 07 20, that's the time of steam pressure peg. Right?
<br><br>
07 23 53 04        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

<br><br>
07 23 58 13        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Okay, Mike. Of course, this is in the event the G&N and the EMS quits and you have to fly the constant g; and what we're trying to do is extend the constant g range from 1100 to 1500 miles. We've run this procedure in the simulator, and it works fine. Basically, I'll go through it - just go through it, and then if you have any questions come back. But it's the same lift vector up until MAX g, and then lift vector down, and then modulate the lift vector until g dot goes to zero. Okay. This procedure is essentially the same so far. And then hold g dot zero until you pass the RETRO elapsed time of V circular; and then after you pass this RETRO elapsed time of V circular, roll to a gimbal angle of 45 degrees, and then hold this constant bank angle of 45 degrees until you come to the RETRO elapsed time of drogues. Over.
<br><br>
07 23 59 44        <font color="0000FF">CMP</font><br>
Okay. It sounds straightforward enough. Understand constant g backup backup procedure, lift vector up until MAX g and then lift vector down; then modulate until bank angle until g dot equals zero. Maintain g dot equals zero until subcircular, then roll 45 degrees and hold until drogue time. Over.
<br><br>
08 00 00 07        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
Okay. That's mighty fine, Mike. That's correct.

Okay. I'll probably only be doing it maybe - part of it at six frames a second, some it at one. So I could be changing settings as it goes through.

11, Houston. You can go ahead and turn it on.
<br><br>
08 02 57 24        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
Okay. I'll have to go to command reset to do that.
<br><br>
08 02 57 34 <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>
11, Houston. That's negative. All you have to do is turn it on. That'll be fine.
<br><br>
08 02 57 44        <font color="0000FF">LMP</font><br>
I guess I don't know how to turn it on, then. I got PCM, ANTILOG RECORD, FORWARD; high bit rate, and barber pole.

...
<br><br>
08 03 02 00        <font color="0000FF">CC</font><br>

0kay. I already put it to COMMAND RESET, but I still have barber pole on the tape. And now my switch is high bit rate.
